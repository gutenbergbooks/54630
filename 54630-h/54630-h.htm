<h1 title="">CAMP LENAPE ON THE LONG TRAIL</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">A FEUD BEGINS</span></h2>
<p>Brick Ryan was bending over a washtub
out behind the Lenape lodge when the big,
shiny automobile roared up the road into camp.</p>
<p>Brick paused in the act of wringing out his
best and only flannel shirt, straightened, took
one look at the glittering limousine, and whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Will you look at the golden
chariot!&rdquo; he exclaimed to himself. &ldquo;Brick, my
boy, can it be that a young millionaire is comin&rsquo;
to Camp Lenape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent his flaming mop of copper-colored
hair over the tub once more, but kept a watchful
blue eye on the big car, which had now drawn
up beside the kitchen wood-pile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>From the wheel of the limousine stepped down
a man smartly garbed in the uniform of a chauffeur.
He swiftly threw open the silver-trimmed
rear door, saluted, and offered his arm as the
first of the occupants of the car descended. This
person was a lady, somewhat stout, with a worried
look on her face. Brick saw the flash of
many diamonds glitter on her hands as she
turned and spoke to those still remaining within
the shadowy interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dirk, dearest, here we are! Gracious, what
a rough and dusty road it has been! This camp
must be in a perfect wilderness! John, you must
come with me right away to see the camp director.
I simply must explain to him about
Dirk&rsquo;s diet, and I do hope he will see to it that
Dirk wears his rubbers and heavy underwear
when it rains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband, an older man with hair gray
about the temples, nodded reassuringly as he
joined her. &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he said soothingly,
&ldquo;it will be all right, I&rsquo;m sure. The director
knows his job; he&rsquo;s quite accustomed to looking
after all the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you know Dirk has always been so delicate!
I declare, I wish we had sent him to Wild
Rose Camp again this year&mdash;the nurse there was
so sympathetic. But you would insist that he be
brought to this outlandish place, even when you
knew that none of the boys of our social set
would think of coming to such an ordinary sort
of camp!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Marcia,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;But
Dirk is growing up now. I want him to mix
with a regular gang of fellows his own age, and
do all the things they do. Maybe at first it will
seem a bit like roughing it, but he&rsquo;ll soon get
used to it and be into everything with the best of
them. Isn&rsquo;t that right, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Papa,&rdquo; a bored young voice answered
from the depths of the back seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid, dear,&rdquo; the mother said. &ldquo;I
know you will be a brave lad. Now, your father
and I are going to speak to the director about
your diet. Benson will help you with your luggage,
and you can find out which house you are
going to sleep in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sleep in tents here, Mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tents! You see, John, what sort of place
you have chosen! And you know how easily
Dirk catches cold! The idea of having the boys
sleep in drafty tents! I really must speak to the
director at once!&rdquo; She picked her way delicately
down the hill toward the front of the
lodge, followed by her apologetic husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gollies!&rdquo; Brick Ryan muttered to himself,
and watched for further developments.</p>
<p>They were not long in coming. The chauffeur
went around to the heaped luggage-rack of the
car, and began unloading its bulky contents.
Several shiny suitcases landed on the ground,
followed by a leather hat-box, a bag of golf-clubs,
two tennis racquets, a gun-case, fishing
rods, and finally a large wardrobe trunk, which
the man handled with difficulty. Shouldering
the latter, the man also disappeared down the
hill. Brick scratched his head, stared at the pile
of baggage that still remained, and hung a
patched pair of khaki pants on the line to dry
in the fresh morning air.</p>
<p>He wheeled about as the same drawling voice
he had heard from within the car came to his
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, would you mind lending a hand with
this luggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick looked at the speaker with open mouth.
He saw a tall, pleasant-looking boy of about his
own age, with brown eyes and yellow hair, spick
and span in white flannels and straw hat. Brick
was so startled by the fact that the stranger wore
a stiff white collar and necktie that at first he did
not comprehend what the boy had said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said,&rdquo; the newcomer repeated carefully,
&ldquo;that I would like you to help me with all this
luggage of mine. That is, if it won&rsquo;t interfere
with your laundering work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick slowly drained the soapy water from
the tub, and considered this request. Then he
took a second look at the strange lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not a cripple, are you?&rdquo; he asked
solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you grabbin&rsquo; some
of those bags and hikin&rsquo; down with &rsquo;em yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; the other said patiently.
&ldquo;Of course I shall carry my rod and
racquets, but I don&rsquo;t care to lug these heavy bags
about myself. Just take them down to my tent
like a good chap. I&rsquo;ll pay you, naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick&rsquo;s Irish temper, never far from the surface,
blew up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Dirk Astorbilt, or whatever your
name is, you&rsquo;ve got me all wrong! Where did
you get the idea that Camp Lenape fellows were
a bunch of Pullman porters, standin&rsquo; around
waitin&rsquo; to carry bags for a ten-cent tip? Just
because I happen to be washin&rsquo; out my duds so
I wouldn&rsquo;t look like a hobo, you must think I&rsquo;m
a bellhop or somethin&rsquo;. Well, up here, mister,
every man totes his own pack, see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash; Do you really mean that you are
a fellow-camper, like myself?&rdquo; the blond boy
asked awkwardly.</p>
<p>Brick snorted, stuck his hands in his pocket,
and stared pugnaciously at the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go climb a tent-rope!&rdquo; he exclaimed rudely,
and swaggered off down the hill toward the grove
of pine trees that shadowed the white canvas
dwellings of the Lenape campers.</p>
<p>In the shade beside the flagpole, he sat down
on a log to cool off. With a blue bandana
handkerchief he mopped his freckled brow and
snub nose. A pine-scented breeze fluttered down
the mountainside at his back and ruffled his unruly
red hair. Perhaps he had been a little too
hasty in taking affront at the new boy&rsquo;s request.
He sniffed the air, and its fragrance soon made
him forget the unpleasant encounter with the
strange boy in white flannels. For the thousandth
time, he gazed over the spreading campus
of Lenape, and peace descended on his fiery soul.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Before his eyes, under the limpid blue sky of
August, between the mountains and the little
lake, lay Camp Lenape, summer home of a hundred
lively boys and the dozen councilors who
guided their many outdoor activities. Over his
head, on the long porch of the lodge, he could
hear the uplifted voices of Jake and Jerry Utway;
the twins were skylarking about, followed
by the laughter of &ldquo;Happy Face&rdquo; Frayne, the
genial assistant director. Beyond, from the
kitchen, came a clatter of pans and a snatch of
song as Ellick, the chef, and his dusky minions
prepared lunch. Brick looked down the steep hill
to the boat dock, where a rowboat full of boys
with fish-poles was just coming in from a trip
to the south end of Lake Lenape. He yawned
sleepily, and stretched. From the rows of tents
to his left someone shouted his name.</p>
<p>A group of campers trailed through the bushes
in the wake of Mr. Carrigan, the camp naturalist.
Among the boys who were thus returning
from a nature-study hike were Blackie Thorne,
Soapy Mullins, and Lefty Reardon, the latter of
whom had called out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Ryan!&rdquo; Lefty repeated. &ldquo;Come on
down to the tent, you loafer, and clean up for
inspection!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away!&rdquo; Brick answered lazily, but did
not stir. He hated to break the spell of contentment
that lay over him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Brick Ryan loved Camp Lenape. It meant
everything to him, the camp life, and for three
summers now he had whooped with delight when
the time came to leave the hot city streets behind
and make for the Lenape hills for two months of
busy, carefree sport in the green out-of-doors.
Here, among his camper friends and the wise
leaders like the Chief and Happy Face and Lieutenant
Eames and Mr. Carrigan, he could do to
his heart&rsquo;s content the things he loved&mdash;swim and
fish and get up shows and take long hikes through
the mountains&mdash;&mdash; And this year, for the first
time, he would be allowed to go on the Long
Trail&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The blare of Ted Fellowes&rsquo; bugle, sounding
Recall, broke forth over his head. He rose,
stretched, and sauntered down to Tent One, his
new quarters for the next two-week period.
Every fortnight during the season was moving
day for Lenape; then some of the boys who could
not stay the entire summer would leave, and other
boys would come up from the city to take their
places. At this time, too, the tent assignments
were shifted about so that each camper could get
to know, and live as tent-mates with, a wide
variety of other boys. Brick, who had that morning
been given a bunk in the tent nearest the
lodge, presided over by &ldquo;Sax&rdquo; McNulty, the
comical leader who directed camp dramatics,
wondered idly what sort of gang his new tent-mates
would turn out to be.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>As he entered the tent, Lefty Reardon looked
up as he was spreading his blankets neatly over
his canvas bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s about time you were on the job,&rdquo;
he grinned. &ldquo;What you been doing, Brick?
Picking daisies? How about doing a little fancy
work with a broom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mr. Tent Aide,&rdquo; Brick answered
good-humoredly, and set about making his own
bed. &ldquo;What have you guys been doin&rsquo; all
mornin&rsquo;&mdash;lookin&rsquo; for filly-loo birds up in the tall
timber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Carrigan showed us some partridge.
That&rsquo;s better than loafin&rsquo; in the sun. Say, have
any of the pups hit camp yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Lefty&rsquo;s belittling way of referring
to new boys, tenderfeet who were that day coming
to camp for the first time. Brick groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remind me&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost forgot about
it! Gollies, I was just exchangin&rsquo; sweet words
with one of the juiciest specimens that you&rsquo;ve
ever seen! Mr. Chauncy Montmorency, the
Dude from Swellville! Such a pretty boy, too!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Lefty grunted. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have to see it to believe it. Mama and
Papa and the shover all come along in the family
limmyzine to see that little Algy gets here
without getting his tootsies wet! &lsquo;And I sye,
me good feller,&rsquo;&rdquo; he mimicked, &ldquo;&lsquo;would you be
kind enough to carry me bags down to the
<i>ho</i>-tel?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty&rsquo;s jaw gaped. &ldquo;Gee, he sure must be a
green one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you see him! He&rsquo;s the Millionaire
Baby, and no mistake! I pity the poor guys
that get in his tent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Brick Ryan broke off
suddenly as a shadow fell over his shoulder. He
looked up, and gasped.</p>
<p>At the door of the tent stood a blond young
fellow in white flannels. A few paces away a
chauffeur in uniform stood respectfully, laden
with shiny suitcases and sporting goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there you are again,&rdquo; the lad said breezily.
&ldquo;Sorry to trouble you, but is this Tent One?
If it is, I believe I shall have the pleasure of
sharing it with you chaps. My name is Dirk
Van Horn, and the camp director has assigned
me to stay here. I hope that we shall all be very
happy and friendly tent-mates!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;BRICK RYAN&rsquo;S NOT FOR SALE!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Brick was too aghast to think of anything
to say. He scowled, threw up his hands
helplessly, and deliberately turned his back on
the smiling Van Horn.</p>
<p>But Lefty, whatever he might think about
&ldquo;pups&rdquo; in private, had been appointed councilor&rsquo;s
aide for Tent One, and as such was camper-leader
in charge when Sax McNulty was not in
sight. He rose and extended a hand to the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to meet you, Van. My name&rsquo;s Reardon.
I see you&rsquo;ve got a baseball glove there
among your things. We need good fielders on
the camp team&mdash;some stiff games are coming up.
We&rsquo;ll talk about it later. Yes, this is Tent One.
I hear you&rsquo;ve met Brick Ryan, over here,&rdquo; he said
easily. &ldquo;The rest of the bunch will be along
pretty quick, except for some of the new boys
that are hitting camp today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. We passed a hay-wagon full of
young chaps down the road a few miles,&rdquo; answered
Van Horn. &ldquo;They seemed to be having
lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be along later, I guess. Hope we get
some good ones for Tent One. Sax McNulty
went down to show them the way. He&rsquo;s our
leader&mdash;you ought to hear him shake out a tune
from that saxophone of his! Then, outside of
you and Brick and myself, we&rsquo;ve got little Joey
Fellowes and Slim Yerkes&mdash;&mdash; But dump your
stuff down here on the floor, and after lunch I&rsquo;ll
show you where to stow things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benson, the chauffeur, gladly stacked his load
of baggage inside the tent, and returned for the
remainder. His young master spread his legs
apart and looked over the tent with a patronizing
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice little place you&rsquo;ve got here, but it could
be fixed up better. I&rsquo;ve got some pennants and
a few pictures in my trunk that we can stick
around to make it look quite homelike, I fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty smiled grimly. &ldquo;We mostly do our decorating
up at the lodge, where there&rsquo;s plenty of
room. With seven fellows and a leader in a tent
this size, we have to save space for the things we
use every day. You seem to have a lot of junk
there&mdash;enough to take up a whole tent yourself.
After lunch we&rsquo;ll weed out what you need and
the rest can be stored under the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. A chap wants to
be comfortable, doesn&rsquo;t he? Oh, I guess there
are my folks coming to say good-bye! Hello,
Mama!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick scornfully watched the approach of the
fond parents. The lady, after embracing her
boy, looked disdainfully about the tent and its
simple furnishings. She did not sniff, but she
looked as if she might at any moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, John, do you really think we
should leave Dirk here? I&rsquo;m glad we thought to
bring up his spring cot and mattress&mdash;the idea of
having a growing boy sleep on plain canvas
stretchers like these!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other boys don&rsquo;t seem to have suffered,&rdquo;
Mr. Van Horn smiled feebly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Reardon, Papa,&rdquo; his son said. &ldquo;Plays
baseball, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Fine! Well, young men, Benson is
bringing down a big watermelon for Dirk&rsquo;s tent-mates.
Guess you won&rsquo;t mind a cool slice later
on? Now, Dirk, your mother and I are going.
We&rsquo;ll have lunch in Elmville. If you want anything,
write or wire me and we&rsquo;ll see what the old
man can do. That canoe ought to be along in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Papa.&rdquo; Dirk turned to Lefty.
&ldquo;Back in a minute, old chap.&rdquo; He waved a hand
and accompanied his parents up the hill toward
the waiting automobile, where no doubt a fond
farewell was to take place.</p>
<p>As soon as they were out of sight, Brick faced
his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fine sister we drew!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Well, what do you think of the Millionaire
Baby now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty returned to his task of tidying up the
tent beside his bunk. &ldquo;Aw, lay off, Brick. It
isn&rsquo;t his fault he&rsquo;s a poor little rich boy. He
seems to me like a pretty decent sort, and that
watermelon will come in mighty handy, too. Just
because he took you for a kitchen mechanic,
you&rsquo;ve got it in for him. Snap out of it! There
goes First Call, and here&rsquo;s the tent still in a gosh-awful
mess. Stir yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan bent moodily to the work. After
a moment, he snorted as his eye fell once more on
the shiny heap of luggage and sport outfits, and
his scorn broke forth anew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, Lefty my son, Little Lord
Fauntleroy will need a bit of polishin&rsquo; before he&rsquo;s
a true-blue Lenape man, and F. X. A. Ryan is
the lad to give it to him,&rdquo; he muttered darkly.
&ldquo;Mark my words, young Chauncy is in for a lot
of fine adventures he never dreamed of back in
dear old Swellville!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During lunch, Brick listened with ill-concealed
disgust while young Van Horn chatted with
Lefty about baseball and prep school and asked
the usual list of silly questions that a new camper
always puts. When the meal was over, Brick
and silent Slim Yerkes washed the dishes in short
order, and then retired to the tent for quiet hour.
Slim soon left to visit a friend in a neighboring
tent, and Brick stretched out on his bunk with a
copy of the life-saving manual, to study up for
the various tests that were a part of the badge
requirements. But no sooner had he settled himself
than Dirk Van Horn, followed by the admiring
little Joey Fellowes, came down from the
camp store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a silly rule they have here, that a fellow
can&rsquo;t spend more than fifteen cents a day at the
store!&rdquo; Dirk was complaining, munching a chocolate
bar. &ldquo;Up at Wild Rose Camp last year
we could spend as much as we wanted, and they
had everything&mdash;ice-cream cones every day.
Why, I could buy out this little store if I wanted
to! Here, youngster, have a bag of almonds.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Joey admiringly. &ldquo;Say, what
kind of a place was that Wild Rose Camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very select. I believe it cost me five hundred
dollars a season, not counting extras, such as
piano lessons, archery, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan said &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; in a loud tone,
but Joey was visibly impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, youngster,&rdquo; Dirk went on, &ldquo;shall we
get busy unloading all these traps of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Say, if you could go to such a swell
place as that, how come you&rsquo;re here at Lenape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a notion of Papa&rsquo;s. You see, he
used to go to college with the camp director here.
I made Papa buy me a canoe all my own if I
promised to come here, but I tell you, if I don&rsquo;t
like this place, I shan&rsquo;t stay very long.&rdquo; Dirk
turned airily and stooped to open the large wardrobe
trunk that stood amidst his heap of luggage.
&ldquo;Shall we get to work?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Brick Ryan, whose sole possessions had come
to Lenape with him in a canvas dunnage-bag,
pretended to read, but he kept one eye on the
proceedings. Languidly Dirk, aided by the awed
Joey, began to unpack his multitude of belongings.
First he unrolled a thick mattress&mdash;the
only mattress in camp aside from those in the
hospital tent&mdash;and spread it on the lower bunk
nearest the lodge. Brick felt called upon to
interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that bunk belongs to Sax
McNulty, our leader. All the other lower bunks
are already taken. You&rsquo;ll have to take one of
the uppers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joey broke in hastily. &ldquo;Say, Van, I got a
lower, but I don&rsquo;t mind sleeping up in Heaven&mdash;I&rsquo;m
used to it. You can have mine, over here,
and I&rsquo;ll take the upper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk nodded. &ldquo;Thanks. Very sporting of
you, youngster.&rdquo; He spread the mattress on the
bunk that Joey had relinquished, and with an inexperienced
hand spread sheets and fine woolen
blankets in the semblance of a bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Next he began unpacking the trunk and suitcases,
and Brick Ryan&rsquo;s snorts grew louder and
louder as the stack of the newcomer&rsquo;s possessions
grew higher. In a short time the tent was strewn
with clothing and objects of all sorts. The leader&rsquo;s
empty bunk was piled high with suits of
every kind and shade, among them a trim blue
yachting outfit with white cap, and a khaki uniform
with Sam Browne belt and white helmet
such as African explorers wear. One suitcase
was almost completely taken up with books and
a portable typewriter. Between reading the
books and dressing up in the dozen different
suits, Brick reflected, the new boy would have
very little time to do any camping.</p>
<p>But this was not all. It seemed as if Dirk
must have gone into a big sporting-goods store
and ordered at least one of everything in stock.
He had complete outfits for baseball, basketball,
and track. Joey was set to work stringing up an
aerial for a portable radio receiving set that was
carefully packed in a leather case. The interior
of the tent was submerged beneath such objects
as a big electric lantern, a fisherman&rsquo;s creel, two
swimming suits, a sketching outfit, golf clubs,
hats and shoes of all sorts, and a black bag such
as is carried by doctors on their rounds. Dirk
opened the latter, and took from its well-filled
interior a bottle of pills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That reminds me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Forgot to
take my prescription.&rdquo; He swallowed two pills,
made a face, and picking up an armload of shoes
and a banjo case, approached Brick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, old fellow,&rdquo; he said agreeably,
&ldquo;but would you mind awfully if I parked these
things under your bed? These tents don&rsquo;t seem
to have any closets in them, and that clothes-line
from the tent-poles doesn&rsquo;t look very strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; Brick answered shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You don&rsquo;t seem to have a great
deal of junk yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick groaned. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said with some
heat. &ldquo;Lefty Reardon told you he&rsquo;d show you
where to put your stuff. He&rsquo;s up at aide&rsquo;s meeting
now, and since Sax is still away, I don&rsquo;t mind
tellin&rsquo; you what the rules are. We got eight people
in this tent. Suppose every single one of
them had as much stuff as you&rsquo;ve got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can see they haven&rsquo;t, so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! We have inspection here every day,
to see which tent wins the pennant. Everything
has got to be in its place, and there&rsquo;s a place for
everything. Beds made in a certain way, clothes
folded in a certain way, shoes in a line under the
bunk, everything polished up and swept out. Do
you figure on cleanin&rsquo; up all that stuff every day,
or are you goin&rsquo; to hire Joey as a valet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear chap, I merely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My advice to you,&rdquo; Brick went on, &ldquo;is to
pick out from that mess just what you need every
day, and store the rest in the lodge. Then we
might have some room to move around. Do you
get that?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>A crimson flush mounted from beneath Dirk&rsquo;s
immaculate white collar and spread over his pale
features, but he said nothing. He dropped the
things on the floor in a heap, and sat down on a
locker-box, watching Joey sort out a collection
of stockings and handkerchiefs. Brick pointedly
returned to his life-saving manual.</p>
<p>For the first time since he had arrived at Lenape
a few hours before, Dirk Van Horn paused
to think. He could not see that he had done anything
to merit such a harsh tone as that used by
the red-headed Irish boy. Of course there was
that awkward mistake when Ryan had been
washing his things back of the kitchen; but that
might have happened to anyone. Dirk had never
before met a boy of the independent stripe of
Brick Ryan. There had been no boys like him
at &ldquo;select&rdquo; Wild Rose Camp, nor in what his
mother called their &ldquo;social set&rdquo; back in the city.
But Dirk wanted everybody to like him. He
wanted Brick to like him and admire him. He
went about it in the only way he knew&mdash;but it was
the wrong way.</p>
<p>Brick was aware of a tap on his shoulder. He
turned; before him stood the despised Van Horn
in his citified garments. There was a smile on
his face. His right hand was outstretched
frankly; his left hand held a tennis racquet of the
most expensive make.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Ryan, old chap,&rdquo; Dirk began.
&ldquo;We have to live together. Let&rsquo;s be friends!
What say? I know I was a chump a while ago,
but I apologize, and I hope we&rsquo;ll get along splendidly.
Now, just to show you I think a lot of
you, I hope you&rsquo;ll accept this little present. It&rsquo;s
just a trifle, and I have two of them&mdash;but perhaps
it will prove how much I want to be your
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the amazed Brick knew what was happening,
the other had pressed the handle of the
racquet into his hand, and clapped him on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit! Now we&rsquo;re fast friends,
you know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick stared at the gift. Fashioned of finest
wood and gut, it represented at the least an
amount that Brick would have had to work on his
paper-route, back in the city, for a month to earn.
Unbelievingly he looked from the gift to the
giver. A sudden tide of red anger flooded his
freckled face to the roots of his red hair. He
jumped up, flung off the outstretched hand, and
faced Van Horn. There was an ugly look on his
face, and ugly words rose to his Irish tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, is it!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Gollies, you
and your little presents! Pup, get this! You or
the likes of you can&rsquo;t buy Brick Ryan&rsquo;s little finger,
and you can&rsquo;t bribe him, either! You and
all your pretty junk may go over big with kids
like Joey that don&rsquo;t know any better, but Brick
Ryan&rsquo;s not for sale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk&rsquo;s mouth fell open, and he backed off hastily.
&ldquo;Why&mdash;Why, I&rsquo;m sorry&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;d take it that way! Of course, if you don&rsquo;t
care to accept it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah!&rdquo; cried the Irish boy. With sudden
fury he flung the offending tennis racquet in a
wide curve. It fell out of sight into a clump of
bushes some yards away; and Brick Ryan, with
clenched fists, turned on his heel and stalked from
the tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">&ldquo;HELP!&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>Dirk Van Horn wondered if he were
going to like Camp Lenape. There seemed
to be far too many uncomfortable rules that got
in the way when a fellow wanted to have some
fun. Then, too, outside of little Joey Fellowes,
nobody had seemed duly impressed with his father&rsquo;s
wealth and his luxurious camping outfit.
It was clear that this was going to be quite different
from Wild Rose Camp, where everyone knew
that he was J. T. Van Horn&rsquo;s only son, and
where he and his tutor had shared a cosy cottage
with every convenience that money could buy.</p>
<p>Dirk sighed; then turned suddenly as a new
idea struck him. He&rsquo;d show these kids what a
real sportsman could do!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joey, old son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;would you mind
clearing up the rest of this stuff? I&rsquo;m going to
take a look around the woods and see what the
chances are for a bit of sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you going to do, Van?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a bit of gunning. That chap Reardon
mentioned at lunch that he had scared up
some partridge on the mountain this morning. I
thought I might get a shot at a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joey Fellowes stood aghast at such daring.
&ldquo;Whe&mdash;you mean, shoot them? Say, nobody at
Lenape ever does that! We just go out and
watch birds and animals and things, and try to
study them and take pictures of them. Nobody
in camp is supposed to have a gun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! What do they come up here in the
woods for? Well, here&rsquo;s one person who isn&rsquo;t
going to overlook a chance if he happens to see
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash; Why, Sax McNulty or any
of the rest of the councilors would sure bawl you
out if they found you with a gun! It&rsquo;s against
the camp rules!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother the old rules! Good heavens, McNulty
may change his mind pretty quick if I
present him with a nice bag of partridge ready
for Tent One to eat for supper.&rdquo; With deliberate
casualness, Dirk slung his gun-case over his
shoulder, unearthed from a suitcase a large box
of chocolate cake as provisions, and paused at the
door of the tent. &ldquo;Come along if you like, Fellowes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no thanks,&rdquo; blurted Joey. &ldquo;You better
report to the Chief before you go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo; said Dirk carelessly.
&ldquo;Well, then, ta-ta! If you&rsquo;ve got most of my
things stowed away by the time I come back, I&rsquo;ll
slip you a dollar or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these generous words, Dirk waved an
easy farewell, and strode off through the trees,
taking care to make a wide circle about the
lodge, where some fussy councilor might see him
and keep him from his purpose. His plan was
simple. He wanted to make Brick Ryan and the
rest of the campers realize what a fine fellow was
now in their midst. If he could casually stroll
into the tent with a dozen partridge in one hand
and his shiny new rifle in the other, they would
see at a glance that here was a comrade to be
reckoned with! He conjured up pleasant pictures
of their surprise and admiration, himself
the center of the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>Still lost in these happy visions, he crossed a
sunny meadow and picked his way over the
dusty, rutted country road that led to camp.
Here he plunged into thick woods, making
straight up the mountainside. It was cool in
the leafy forest, and he would have been very
well contented save that a swarm of gnats hovered
over his hatless head in a buzzing cloud,
following wherever he went. His coat was too
warm, but he did not want to carry it as his hands
were already full, and he wished to be free in case
he located the desired covey of partridge.</p>
<p>Ahead lay a flat, marshy stretch of ground,
where clumps of grass and rotting tree-limbs
formed a half-submerged, muddy mass. There
was no path going around, and Dirk, balancing
his burdens dangerously, jumped from one solid-looking
tuft to another. More than once he
slipped on the rotting stuff, and floundered
ankle-deep in slimy water. Long before he
reached the other side, he regretted that he had
not changed his city flannels for togs more suited
to mountain work. His low sport shoes were
caked with ooze and half full of water; his erstwhile
spotless white flannels were muddied,
streaked with green scum, and a triangular tear
on one leg showed where he had come up against
a sharp branch.</p>
<p>Ruefully he sank to a seat on a decayed oak-trunk
and unloosened his wilted linen collar. He
would have liked a drink, but he knew that the
stagnant pools at his feet were unhealthy, and
he settled back, inspected his glistening rifle to
see that the magazine was full of .22 caliber
cartridges, and then slowly began munching the
cake he had brought with him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>He had barely eaten half of it, however, when
he leaped hastily from his seat with a cry. One
arm was afire, beneath the sleeve, with a thousand
prickling stings! A simmering stream of large
black ants that infested the rotting wood&mdash;no
doubt attracted by the chance of refreshment in
the shape of sweet crumbs of cake&mdash;was flowing
over his hand and arm, and even beneath the
collar of his shirt. In a painful frenzy he dropped
the cake and began brushing off the stinging insects,
stripping off his coat and shirt. It was
several minutes before he could fight free of the
crawling horde, and then, grabbing his things, he
rushed off up the hillside away from the treacherous
lower ground. Even then, he was reminded
now and again of his misadventure by a red-hot
sting in some part of his tender skin beneath his
clothing.</p>
<p>So far, his expedition had not been successful.
He had not seen any sign of a partridge or any
other small game. Even had there been any of
the birds in that part of the mountain, his stumbling
progress would undoubtedly have given
them warning long before he could train his rifle
on them. But he kept on up the slope, smashing
his way through the thick underbrush and trying
not to turn his ankles on the rocky ground underfoot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>To his right he saw through the leaves a long
scar of gray rock outcropping on the hillside.
This promised easier going than the tangled underbrush.
Besides, he thought, if he could get
high enough, he might be able to look around
and see in just which direction lay the camp. His
flight from the marsh had twisted him around
somehow, and a glance at the sky gave him the
feeling that the sun was not where it should
rightly be at this time in the afternoon. He
altered his course and began scaling the sloping,
moss-encrusted rocks.</p>
<p>Before he was half-way up the rocks, he began
to wish he had not chosen such a steep and rough
road. His shoes and trousers were in pitiful
shape. Still he scrambled upward in the hot sunshine,
dripping perspiration, ascending on hands
and knees and trailing his rifle after him. He
was glad to see that the rocks ended a few feet
above his head in an overhanging bank of earth
and matted shrubs. Over the top! He charged
the little cliff, seized with his free hand the roots
of a sapling oak that grew on the edge, and tried
to haul himself up. His first heave loosened the
soil; he could feel his hold slipping. He cast a
fearful eye backwards; if he fell on those sharp
rocks&mdash;&mdash;!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>A shower of dirt, twigs, and small pebbles rattled
down upon his head; with a rending noise,
the roots he was gripping parted. Clawing the
air helplessly, Dirk fell backwards, and slid painfully
a few feet down the smooth rocks. His
rifle flew from his hand, described a short circle
in the air, and landed with a bruising crash upon
his outstretched right leg.</p>
<p>Dirk cried out, and rubbed his shin. The sharp
blow brought tears of pain into his eyes, and he
gritted his teeth. He realized now that it had
been a foolish thing to trust his weight to such
a sketchy hand-hold. Well, he had suffered for
his error!</p>
<p>He clutched the rifle, whose wooden stock was
badly scarred by the fall, and began crawling
across the rocks to the shelter of the brush.
Every movement heightened the ache in his leg,
which was now throbbing brutally. When he
gained the wooded hillside, he rose and tried to
walk; but after a few steps he gave up, sat down,
and began rubbing his shinbone once more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Dirk was not used to giving up an idea easily,
and he hated to think of limping back to camp
with torn clothes, and lacking the game he had
set out so proudly to get. Here would be a very
different return from that he had visualized!
But now he began looking about him and puzzling
just in which direction lay Camp Lenape.</p>
<p>The sound of a bugle call floating up from the
lake came to his ears, and faintly he could hear
shouting, off to his right, where the woods were
thickest. He could not be exactly sure where
it came from, but evidently camp was not far
away. Of course, he could back-track on his
own trail, but that would mean going through
the marsh again. There must be a short cut
that he could take. He rose and began hobbling
through the trees, hoping to find a stream
where he could quench his hot thirst. As he
went he thought of his mother and father, by
this time far on the way back to the city. Dirk
Van Horn was just a little homesick.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Again came the bugle-call. But this time it
sounded from behind him! He wheeled about,
listening. Where was camp? He could see
nothing through the trees. Perhaps if he could
climb high enough, he might catch a glimpse of
the flagpole or the tents; but his leg was now
swollen and stiff, and useless for climbing.
Where was he, anyway? Could it be that he
was lost among the mountains? Lost! Dirk
began to run unsteadily through the thick
brush. His eyes were wild, and the little hammers
of panic were beating in his brain.</p>
<p class="tb">Brick Ryan was slipping into his swimming
suit in Tent One when Sax McNulty, followed
by a racing pack of boys, appeared at the lower
end of the campus. The new recruits had hit
camp just in time for afternoon swim period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Sax!&rdquo; the red-headed boy greeted his
leader. &ldquo;You look hot. Just in time for a
dip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long-faced young man gave him a mournful
look. Sax always looked gloomy, even when
he was saying his funniest things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little sunbeam,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I
can keep smiling even after piloting twenty little
greenhorns up from Elmville. Dusty but smiling.
Say, who made my bed so nicely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and Lefty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good lads.&rdquo; Sax sank on his bunk and began
stripping off his dust-laden garments. &ldquo;I
met two of the new fellows who&rsquo;ll be with us
this section. Nig Jackson was one&mdash;you remember
him from last year. Another is a new kid,
Eddie Scolter, who claims he can play a clarinet.
But one fellow didn&rsquo;t come after all, I guess.
The Chief said his name was Van Horn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; grinned Brick, &ldquo;you mean the Millionaire
Baby! Well, don&rsquo;t worry about him.
He got here this mornin&rsquo;, and has been around
all day, big as life and twice as natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Millionaire Baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick pointed to the scattered array of suitcases,
clothes, and other possessions that Joey
Fellowes had given up trying to sort out and
arrange. Sax McNulty whistled as he looked
at Dirk&rsquo;s heaped outfit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This all belong to Van Horn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Junk enough for ten guys. Wait till you
get a look at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sax shook his head. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t have that. Where
is he, anyway? He&rsquo;ll have to stow that stuff before
Nig and Eddie and the rest get here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me,&rdquo; Brick shrugged. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
seen him since siesta. He&rsquo;s probably off tellin&rsquo;
the little kids what a rich guy his dad is, and
how Wild Rose Camp is much sweller than this
joint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader pulled on his swimming suit, and
looked up thoughtfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me he&rsquo;s the
son of Van Horn, the bank president! Don&rsquo;t tell
me that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s going to be here in Tent One this
section. Well, well, and a couple more wells!
You don&rsquo;t seem to have taken to him very kindly,
Brick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He just sort of riled me from the start, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll be all right after a couple days
here. No quarreling, now! We must all be like
little birdies in the nest, Brick&mdash;&mdash; Hark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan had heard it too. From the mountainside
had come a despairing cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jumped to his feet, and the two, leader
and boy, stared solemnly into each other&rsquo;s faces.
Then McNulty grabbed for a pair of rubber-soled
tennis shoes, and began furiously lacing
them on his bare feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, Brick!&rdquo; He dived for the door
of the tent and up the wooded hillside, his red-headed
follower close on his heels. &ldquo;Somebody
in trouble on the mountain! We&rsquo;ve got to run,
old boy&mdash;and I mean run!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DIRK JUMPS</span></h2>
<p>In the wake of his racing leader, Brick Ryan
dashed through the thickets behind the tent,
and crossed the road. Here Sax paused and
shouted toward the mountainside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead came a faint cry in answer, and a spitting
crack. Something buzzed through the leaves
of a maple overhead, and a detached twig drifted
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a gun!&rdquo; said Brick in amazement.
&ldquo;Somebody shootin&rsquo; through the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sax was angry. &ldquo;The fool!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Is
he trying to pick us off?&rdquo; He raised his voice
and shouted again to the unknown. &ldquo;Cut out
that shooting! We&rsquo;re coming right along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he plunged into the woods. Brick, who
had been rubbing his uncovered arms and legs
where his swimming suit had not protected him
from scratches and whipping branches, panted
at his side. &ldquo;Over this way it came from, Sax,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Not very far off, either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>McNulty saved his wind for running, and his
long legs bounded out of sight. In short order,
Brick heard the man&rsquo;s voice upraised in stinging
rebuke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that gun down! Here, give it to me,
before you kill a few of us! Now, What do you
mean by this&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick came to the edge of a little glade, and
saw the leader standing threateningly above a
youth who crouched on the sward, guiltily handing
over his weapon. His body was covered with
a stained blue coat and the wreckage of a pair
of white flannel trousers; his yellow hair was
rumpled; and on his pale face there was a look
of mingled relief and dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begolly,&rdquo; said Brick to himself, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the
Baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sax McNulty seized the rifle and poured out
the contents of the magazine into his hand.
&ldquo;What are you trying to do?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What
do you mean by shooting around Camp Lenape?
Who are you, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick came up, and grinned at his councilor,
indicating the prostrate figure on the ground.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the guy I was tellin&rsquo; you about, Sax,&rdquo; he
sneered. &ldquo;Young Moneybags. What else could
you expect?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my name is Van Horn,&rdquo; the other boy
stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a camper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A camper? You?&rdquo; McNulty was scornful.
&ldquo;Well, you must be in the wrong camp.
At Lenape we don&rsquo;t go around firing rifles all
over the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn swallowed, and began clambering
to his feet. &ldquo;I&mdash;I got lost,&rdquo; he began.
&ldquo;I read somewhere that three shots was a signal
for help. They didn&rsquo;t sound very loud, so I
shouted, too. I imagined that someone might
hear me and direct me back to the camp ground.
You see, sir, I hurt my leg&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I can walk on it now. But then I got
a trifle frightened, I suppose, and things got
mixed up somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick broke into a rasping laugh. &ldquo;Lost, is
it! He gets lost a few hundred yards from camp,
and yells for help! You got a job ahead of you,
Sax. He don&rsquo;t need a councilor&mdash;it&rsquo;s a nurse-maid
he needs!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Brick,&rdquo; the man said shortly.
&ldquo;Now, Van Horn, if you can walk all right,
we&rsquo;ll go back to the tent. I understand you&rsquo;ve
been assigned to my outfit. Well, first off, if
you&rsquo;ve got any more guns, they&rsquo;re going to be
locked up with this one. We can&rsquo;t have bullets
flying about. Come along&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show you where
camp is. After swim, we&rsquo;ll see about clearing
up that mess of stuff you left on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way back toward the campus, bearing
the forbidden weapon, followed by the crestfallen
Dirk. Brick Ryan began cautiously picking
a path through the underbrush&mdash;a swimming
suit was not the best uniform for mountain rescue-work.
He chuckled. &ldquo;Lost, he was! And
Sax and I thought we were goin&rsquo; to pull somebody
out of trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bushes ahead crackled as somebody ran
through, and Brick paused. The face of his
friend Kipper Dabney appeared from behind a
tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all the shootin&rsquo;, Brick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick answered the question with a laugh.
&ldquo;You may think you&rsquo;ve seen greenhorns at Lenape,
Kipper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I want to tell you
we&rsquo;ve got the juiciest tenderfoot in Tent One
that you ever saw. He&rsquo;s a lily, he is! There he
goes&mdash;Sax McNulty just grabbed his gun in
time to keep him from shootin&rsquo; us for a couple
of moose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kipper was interested. &ldquo;You sound as if you
figured on doing something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I will,&rdquo; smiled Brick wickedly. &ldquo;Out
of the goodness of my heart, I might show him a
few handy tricks. He sure needs a workout!&rdquo;
He lowered his voice. &ldquo;About twelve o&rsquo;clock
tonight, eh? What about it, my boy? Are you
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;pass him the runaround?&rdquo; the
other asked doubtfully. &ldquo;He looks like a pretty
husky fellow. He might go for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a chance! But if you&rsquo;re nervous, we&rsquo;ll
get Ugly Brown to come too. This baby is easy.
Is it a go? Swell! Now let&rsquo;s get down to the
dock&mdash;that guy and his fool stunts have made
me miss half my swim!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Dirk Van Horn did not fall asleep until some
while after taps had sounded bedtime for the
Lenape campers, and their big bonfire had died
down to embers. He had gone through one of
the liveliest days he had ever known, but although
weary, he was too wakeful to join his
tent-mates in their slumbers. He lay stretched
on his bunk, staring up at the dim, quiet stars
glowing above the sighing branches of the pines,
and recalling the events of the crowded day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Around him, snug in their blankets, slept his
new tent-mates. It was a strange feeling. Last
night he had gone to bed in his familiar room
back home in the city, with his father and mother
close at hand. Tonight he lay out under canvas,
in the forest-clad Lenape hills, listening to the
unknown noises of the night and the deep breathing
of his new-found companions&mdash;Mr. McNulty,
and Lefty, and Joey, and the other Tent
Two boys he had met at supper. On the line
from the ridgepole hung his brand-new camping
togs, and the other things he needed were neatly
stowed beneath the bunk or in his wooden locker,
as Lefty had shown him. Lefty had said that
some baseball games were coming&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Dirk sighed. Lefty must know all about his
ignominious return from his hunting trip that
afternoon. If Lefty thought him a chump, perhaps
he wouldn&rsquo;t put him on the camp team!
He could see now that he had made a fool of
himself with his silly rifle, but how was he to
know all the camp rules? And that Brick Ryan
chap had snickered at him! Why did Ryan dislike
him so? Thinking of Brick Ryan, the new
camper drifted off into slumber....</p>
<p>He opened his eyes. His cheek was tingling.
Something had trailed across his face in the dark!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Through the trees he saw the yellow sickle of
a new moon. He remembered now. He was at
Camp Lenape&mdash;&mdash; But whose was the voice
close to his ear, whispering cautious words?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shh! Listen, Van Horn, are you awake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head, and saw the outline of a
strange face above him. A boy whom he did
not know had thus quietly aroused him in the
dead of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put on your slippers and bathrobe and come
on!&rdquo; the voice urged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wake up anybody
else. This is just for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dirk asked hoarsely.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I know you. What do you
want me for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; the strange boy urged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
a party. We want you to be our guest. Just a
little fun after taps, old man. Quick, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wonderingly, Dirk obeyed. He found his
slippers and robe in the pale light, while his guide
waited motionless. Taking care not to make the
least noise to disturb the sleeping leader and the
other boys of Tent One, Dirk crept softly out
into the thin moonlight. His guide took his arm,
and led the way down a path that skirted the
upper row of tents, and then wandered into the
mysterious shadow of the forest. A hundred
yards beyond the farthest tent, the unknown boy
stopped, and whispered close to Dirk&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re giving a party for you, Van,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;Very select. Some of the best blood
in camp is waiting to greet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;that&rsquo;s very kind of them.&rdquo; Dirk was
flattered. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other hesitated. &ldquo;Well, you see, our
meeting-place is supposed to be kept a secret.
Would you mind wearing this for a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Dirk knew what his guide was about,
he felt a large handkerchief drop over his eyes.
He muttered a protest, but already the blindfold
was knotted about his head, and even the dim
glow of the night was shut from his sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just hang on to my arm,&rdquo; said the stranger
reassuringly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not far off now. This
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave Dirk a slight push ahead. Slowly,
with arms outstretched, Dirk felt his way forward
along the rough path. He did not quite
know what to make of this midnight game of
blind-man&rsquo;s-buff; but he had no reason to think
that the other boy meant him harm. He remembered
that at Wild Rose Camp last summer, it
was often the thing to have quiet little
&ldquo;spreads&rdquo; after bedtime, without the knowledge
of the councilors. Seemingly, Lenape also enjoyed
this adventurous custom; and he took it
as a tribute to himself that he, a newcomer,
should have been selected to be honored on his
first night on the campus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>While he was pondering this he was stumbling
ahead over the rough ground, now and then tripping
over a rock or tree-root and leaning heavily
on the arm of the boy at his side. Suddenly, that
arm was withdrawn; he felt a rude thrust into
his back; he stepped forward to catch himself,
found his ankles snared in a rope that had been
stretched across his path. He tripped and
crashed to the earth, throwing his arms out with
a grunt of pain. He had landed with a smashing
thud into a thicket of scratching branches.</p>
<p>The shock of the impact had driven his breath
out of him; he could not cry out. He thrashed
about upon the rocky ground, trying to tear the
blinding bandage from his eyes. But a sharp
knee was now pressing into the small of his back,
and even as he struggled, someone unseen lashed
his hands together with a skillful handcuff knot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Baby!&rdquo; urged a mocking voice
above him, and the knee dug deeper into his aching
back. &ldquo;How do you like our little party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew this voice! Brick Ryan!</p>
<p>He thrashed about, striving to regain his feet;
but the torturing knee pinned him fast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get worked up,&rdquo; his tormenter advised.
&ldquo;We just want you to do a few little
tricks for us. Lift him up, Kipper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk was jerked roughly to his feet, pinioned
on both sides by strong arms. Behind him rose
again the jeering voice of Ryan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t go wild and hurt yourself. If
you&rsquo;re a nice baby, and do what we tell you,
maybe we&rsquo;ll let you off easy&mdash;maybe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk choked, and found his voice. &ldquo;You are
a coward, Ryan! A coward and a bully!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; came the savage answer. &ldquo;Do
you want to wake up the whole camp?&rdquo; A
sharp point of metal prodded the flesh of Dirk&rsquo;s
leg. &ldquo;Feel that? Any more hot air and you&rsquo;ll
get a touch of this! Now, march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Biting his lip to keep back the cry that rose to
his tongue, Dirk Van Horn was dragged through
the woods. His blindfold was still knotted
tightly over his eyes, and he was helpless in the
hands of his captors. Soon, he could tell by the&rsquo;
feel of smooth earth under the thin soles of his
slippers that they had come to some sort of clearing.
Here his torturers&mdash;he judged that there
were three of them&mdash;halted. Again Ryan spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you&rsquo;ve got so much sportin&rsquo; goods with
you, we thought you must be a swell athlete.
We want to see what you can do on the high
jump and the dash and the obstacle race. That
right, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Dirk stubbornly. &ldquo;Let
me out of this, Ryan. If the camp director knew
you were hazing me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up! Now, the first event will be the
runnin&rsquo; high jump. When I say &lsquo;go!&rsquo; you take
off and show us how to break a record! Don&rsquo;t
try to pull off that blindfold, either, or you&rsquo;ll
get another jab with my knife. Ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The restraining arms were drawn away, but
Dirk stood motionless, refusing to reply. Sightless,
he knew that he could not run, or even walk,
more than a few steps before he would again
be brought to the ground with a crash. Where
was he? Far from any help, any sympathetic
leader who could put a stop to the cruel hazing.
Was Ryan determined to push him, helpless,
through the motions of a travesty of a track meet,
in disregard of bruises and broken bones?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; rasped the voice. &ldquo;Run! Run,
or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk flinched as he felt the sharp knife-point
pierce the skin of his thigh. His terror was rising,
but he did not cry out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>A horrible moment of waiting; then Dirk
heard his unseen tormenter laugh wickedly to
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t play with us, boys! Well, that&rsquo;s
his hard luck! Too bad! It&rsquo;s over the cliff for
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the cliff!&rdquo; echoed the henchmen hollowly.
&ldquo;We gave him his chance. Come on,
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Dirk was dragged through the forest,
more roughly than before. His captors twisted
about so that he had not the least idea in which
direction they were heading, but it seemed as if
ages passed before they halted at last. During
the painful journey he had tried to make some
plan for escape; but it was of no use&mdash;there were
three of them, holding him closely; he could
neither see them nor his surroundings, and his
hands were tightly bound. Was their threat
merely a sham, or were they really now nearing
some steep, jagged wall of rock in the forest?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo; warned Ryan suddenly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re right on the edge of Indian Cliff! Now,
Baby, we&rsquo;ll give you one more chance. Will you
behave and do your stuff in our moonlight track
meet? Or do you want to end up a hundred
feet below, down on those big rocks, with a
busted neck?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Dirk&rsquo;s head was whirling. He tried to fight
free, but the clutch of the restraining arms
tightened, and an ungentle hand made sure his
blindfold was still secure. He cautiously felt
out with one slippered foot. A few inches before
him, the grassy earth ended in a crumbling edge.
A tingle of horror rose up the boy&rsquo;s spine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indian Cliff,&rdquo; Ryan&rsquo;s voice assured him
harshly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where they&rsquo;ll find you in the
mornin&rsquo;. Well, what about it? Yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t dare go through with it!&rdquo; Dirk
cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to frighten me! Well, I
won&rsquo;t be fooled! I don&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t believe us!&rdquo; jeered Brick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to show him. Get ready. Let him go, my
lads!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two henchmen fell back. Dirk turned
swiftly; but the point of the knife caught him in
the side, and he recoiled to the treacherous edge
of the embankment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, Baby! One jump, and it&rsquo;s all over
with you! Well, will you jump yourself, or will
we have to heave you over?&rdquo; Another prod of
the blade accented his words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Dirk swallowed heavily, and tears came into
his shrouded eyes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry for this,
Ryan, you mucker!&rdquo; he shouted. His teeth
were chattering, and a faint breeze fanned his
brow where beads of cold sweat stood out.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a coward&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo; Ryan&rsquo;s tone was ugly.
&ldquo;Do I have to prod you again, or will you
jump?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk took a deep gasp of air, and his muscles
tensed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jump,&rdquo; he said, and leaped blindly forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">THE SINKING OF THE</span> <i>Sachem</i></span></h2>
<p>He still lived!</p>
<p>Dirk drew himself up on one elbow, choking.
His mouth was filled with powdery dust,
and every bone ached. Frenziedly, he thrashed
about, and found he had shaken free of the rope
that had bound his hands together. He reached
up and tore off his blindfold.</p>
<p>In the light of the waning crescent moon, he
looked up. A few inches above his head lay the
bank from which he had leaped into the unknown.
Standing there, doubled with silent laughter,
were the three figures of his torturers. Instead
of jumping to death from a precipitous cliff, he
had plunged dramatically from a ledge barely a
foot high!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>He knew where he was now. To his scattered
senses came the knowledge that he had landed
sprawling in the dirt road that led to camp. The
tents could not be far away, although, blindfolded,
he had thought that Ryan and his gang
had led him for miles through the woods. He
scrambled painfully to his feet and ran up the
road.</p>
<p>Behind him rose an alarmed, muffled shout
from Brick Ryan. &ldquo;Head him off, Kipper!
He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; back to camp! Get him, Ugly!&rdquo;
The shout only made him run faster. Up the
rutted road he sped, flying to security&mdash;anywhere,
away from the clutches of those who had
so brutally mistreated him. His pursuers scattered,
seeking to head through the woods and
cut him off from the tent. Dirk lost a slipper,
but did not pause. If they got their hands on
him again&mdash;&mdash;!</p>
<p>A shape darted out at him from behind a tree.
He dodged, and raced ahead, gasping for breath.
Now he could see the gray sheets of canvas that
marked the tents close beside the dark silhouette
of the lodge. Behind him hammered the running
feet of Brick Ryan. He was almost upon him!</p>
<p>Dirk stumbled into Tent One, and fell upon
the bunk where Sax McNulty slept the sleep of
the weary councilor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me! They&rsquo;re after me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader started up open-mouthed, blinking
his eyes. &ldquo;What&mdash;who&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he mumbled.
&ldquo;Get off!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;Save me, sir! It&rsquo;s Brick Ryan, and he made
me jump over a cliff, and they chased me&mdash;&mdash; Don&rsquo;t
let him get me again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Others in the tent stirred. Slim Yerkes, in
the bunk above the councilor, sat up and silently
looked at the sobbing figure beneath him. Young
Eddie Scolter woke and giggled uncomprehendingly
at the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Van Horn!&rdquo; exclaimed McNulty.
&ldquo;Having a nightmare, old chap? Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan had halted just outside the tent,
and taking advantage of the commotion, sought
to gain his bunk unobserved. He had not intended
that his captive should escape him and
return thus to the tent and arouse the ire of the
leader. He began shedding his garments quickly,
hoping to be found peacefully snoring when Sax
should waken sufficiently to take charge. But
McNulty caught a glimpse of him just as he
was pulling the blankets over his head, and read
the situation in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This some of your work, Brick?&rdquo; he asked
grimly. &ldquo;There, there, calm down, Van, old
man&mdash;why, you&rsquo;re shaking like a leaf! What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;They hazed me!&rdquo; Dirk gulped back the
tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to make such a fuss, but it
hurt&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The councilor snapped on the flashlight he
always kept under his pillow, and examined the
haggard boy at his side. &ldquo;Anything serious the
matter with you? No bones broken, or anything
like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think so, sir. I&rsquo;m ashamed to act
this way,&rdquo; Dirk stammered bravely, &ldquo;but you
see, there were three of them, and they were
pretty rough&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now, just get back to bed, and
we&rsquo;ll straighten things out in the morning.
We&rsquo;ve already roused the whole tent, so don&rsquo;t
make any more noise tonight.&rdquo; McNulty climbed
from his bunk, helped the shaking boy to his own
blankets, covered him gently, and looked about
the tent to assure himself that all was well. Then
he crossed to where Brick Ryan lay crouched,
listening furtively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what the Chief thinks about hazing,
Brick,&rdquo; he said sternly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll start the
day tomorrow with two hours on the wood-pile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Sax,&rdquo; the Irish boy answered sullenly.
&ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t know the big baby was
going to run and tattle! Why didn&rsquo;t he take it
like a man?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough! Now, everybody get to
sleep again. We&rsquo;ve had enough riot for one
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk stretched out his aching body, and closed
his eyes. Through the dark drifted the vengeful
tones of his enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right! But anyway, he&rsquo;s a tattle-tale,
and I&rsquo;ll fix him for it&mdash;you see if I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning period of camp duty found Brick
Ryan on the wood-pile, serving his time chopping
sawn logs into stove lengths and vowing vengeance
upon the boy who had brought the punishment
on him. He looked darkly from time
to time toward the rear door of the camp kitchen,
where the rest of the Tent One campers were
helping to make the ice-cream for the Sunday
dinner. Among them lounged Dirk Van Horn,
who now and then lent a hand at the job of
turning the heavy churn in the freezer, or packed
some more salted ice around the revolving container.
Brick noted that his foe was now dressed
in garments more suited to a Lenape camper&mdash;basketball
shorts and a light, sleeveless shirt. If
Van Horn didn&rsquo;t watch out, Brick mused, he
would be laid up with a bad case of sunburn, for
his shoulders were pale and lacked the protective
coat of tan that marked the boys who had already
spent a month in the mountain sunshine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some people never learn,&rdquo; Brick muttered,
viciously splitting a stick of smooth birchwood.
&ldquo;Runnin&rsquo; home to mama just because we was
havin&rsquo; a little fun with him, and squealin&rsquo; to Sax
so he&rsquo;d make me do wood-pile duty! Well, all I
can say is, my time will come yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the noisy clatter of the
motor of the camp flivver which, driven by Mr.
Lane, rattled down the road and drew up at the
rear of the lodge. In the back of the small
truck, tightly lashed to prevent jolting, was a
long, curved object wrapped securely in burlap.
As Brick watched, Dirk Van Horn gave a shout
and ran to the driver, who was just descending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my canoe you have there, isn&rsquo;t it, sir?
Listen&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t it say it&rsquo;s for Van Horn? That&rsquo;s
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s for you, I guess,&rdquo; answered Lane;
&ldquo;and the dickens of a time I had bringing it
over these roads up from Elmville. We&rsquo;ve got
plenty of canoes here at camp&mdash;what any boy
wants with one all to himself, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk was not listening. He ran to the group
around the ice-cream freezer, and summoned
them excitedly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you chaps! I made my father buy
me a new canoe because I promised to come to
camp, and here it is! Help me unpack it, and
then we&rsquo;ll try it out. It&rsquo;s a beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Lefty Reardon protested. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
on squad duty&mdash;we have to make this ice-cream,
and if we go away now, it won&rsquo;t freeze&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His tent-mates paid no attention to his objection.
Dirk darted into the kitchen and returned
with a long butcher-knife, with which he began
ripping the seams of the burlap that wrapped
the canoe. In a few minutes the casing was torn
away, and the beautiful slim craft, painted a
bright crimson, lay on the ground with its paddles
along its bottom.</p>
<p>Dirk was jumping around excitedly, pointing
out the features of the superb workmanship that
made the canoe a delight to the eye. &ldquo;Look at
her lines, you fellows! See those soft seats.
Those duck-boards on the bottom are to keep
your feet dry. I tell you, you have to pay plenty
of money for a boat like this! She&rsquo;s a real
Indian canoe, and I gave her a real Indian name,
too. See?&rdquo; He pointed to the shapely bow,
where in golden letters was blazoned the name
<i>Sachem</i>. &ldquo;Now, who wants to help me try her
out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s try her out!&rdquo; echoed Eddie Scolter.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to the lake!&rdquo; shouted Dirk. &ldquo;Here,
Slim, grab hold of that end. She&rsquo;s light as a
feather&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have her in the water in no time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim Yerkes obediently lifted one end; Eddie,
Nig Jackson, and Joey Fellowes seized the sides,
and led by the excited Dirk, the group made off
down the path to the boat dock, bearing the
gleaming canoe aloft, leaving her burlap wrappings
to clutter the ground. Lefty, wrestling
alone with the heavy churn of the ice-cream
freezer, shouted a last warning to them, but by
this time his truant comrades were out of sight
down the hill, bent on taking part in the first
launching of the lovely little vessel.</p>
<p>Brick gazed after them disdainfully, impressed
in spite of himself. It was a swell canoe, all
right, and no boy could help being proud of it.
Think of hitting the Long Trail in a craft like
that! But the fellows had no right to leave their
squad duty and run off to play with Van Horn&rsquo;s
new toy&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>An amazed shout rose from the back of the
kitchen. Sax McNulty, who had been working
up in the ice-house, digging out large blocks of
ice and heaving them down to his young assistants,
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
had finished and returned to the scene to
find that his squad, with the exception of the
faithful Lefty, had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s happened? Where is everybody,
Lefty? Have they walked out on the job?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty grunted, struggling with the freezer
handle that grew stiffer at each turn. &ldquo;Yeah,
Sax&mdash;I told &rsquo;em not to beat it, but Van Horn
just got a canoe, and they all took it down to
the lake to christen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did, eh? Well, they&rsquo;ll have to learn
that they can&rsquo;t run away like this when their
duty is still to be done. Here, let me take a turn
at that, Lefty. When you&rsquo;re rested, you can
chop some more ice. Huh! If you hadn&rsquo;t stuck
to the job, the camp would be missing its dessert
this noon, all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader grappled with the freezer. Brick
turned to his chopping once more, and at the
sound of his ax, McNulty looked over toward
the wood-pile and saw him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Brick! I guess you&rsquo;ve served your time.
Do me a favor, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Sax. What do you want?&rdquo; replied
Brick, sinking the ax blade into the chopping
block.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chase down to the lake and head off that
bunch of runaways. Tell &rsquo;em to come right back
and finish what they started, before playing
around with canoes and things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick needed no urging. He wanted to see
what would happen at the lake shore. By this
time, the canoe was no doubt already in the
water. He ran off down the hillside in a bee-line
for the dock. Behind the lower row of tents he
sped, across the stone wall, and cut across the
edge of the baseball field to the grove of trees
that fringed the rocky lake shore. Here he
almost tumbled over the bent backs of Wally
Rawn, director of water sports and captain of
the camp life-saving crew, and the seven boys
who made up his tent-group. Rawn had chosen
as his squad duty the task of repairing the steps
that led down the steep bank to the dock; and
Brick had to circle around the busy group to
gain the edge of the lake where the boat dock
jutted out from the shore.</p>
<p>Here, in the shallows of the bathing beach, the
<i>Sachem</i> was already afloat, riding high above the
rippling, shadowed waters of Lenape. She was
held at one end by the proud Dirk, while the
other boys gazed admiringly at her daintiness,
that made the moored string of round-bottomed
steel rowboats of the camp fleet look like clumsy
craft indeed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me get in her!&rdquo; Dirk was shouting
in a high voice. &ldquo;Let me paddle her around a
bit, and then maybe I&rsquo;ll take you all for a ride!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew the light vessel close beside the flooring
of the dock, and balancing the paddles in one
hand, started to step into the bow. Brick clattered
on to the end of the pier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows!&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;Sax says to
come back on the job right away. He&rsquo;s pretty
mad, too&mdash;you&rsquo;re not supposed to sneak off
squad duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk turned upon him coldly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
foolish, Ryan. Can&rsquo;t you see we&rsquo;re busy christening
the <i>Sachem</i>? If you don&rsquo;t make a fuss, I&rsquo;ll
take you for a little spin after a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blond boy was not listening. He was
too much interested in making his maiden trip in
the newly-launched crimson canoe. Teetering
precariously, he stepped into the bobbing bow.
Before he could clutch the piles of the dock to
hold the craft steady, the <i>Sachem</i> sheered off
and, overburdened by the standing figure at one
end, began rocking dangerously from side to
side. Dirk swayed, trying to keep his balance as
a wave slapped the dancing vessel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; shouted Nig Jackson. &ldquo;Look
out, she&rsquo;ll turn over!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk, alarmed, dropped the paddles overside
and grabbed at the gunwale to keep himself from
following them into the shallow waters of the
beach. In sudden panic, he scrambled to a seat;
but it was too late. The <i>Sachem</i> heeled over
across the wind; a sheet of water slid easily over
the low side, slapped the light canoe to leeward,
and dipped it once more below the surface.
Water filled half the interior, sloshing about and
rocking so that still more water was taken over
the gunwale. Dirk gripped the seat desperately,
trying to right the canoe; but his efforts were
now of no avail.</p>
<p>Slowly, steadily, the <i>Sachem</i> sank to rest on
the pebbled shallows beneath the surface of the
lake, and Dirk Van Horn, with a comic look of
amazement on his face, found himself sitting
waist-deep in the water with his lovely possession
beneath him, out of sight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FIGHT! FIGHT!</span></h2>
<p>Brick burst out in a cry of derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sunk!&rdquo; he roared. &ldquo;You sure scuttled
yourself, all right! You don&rsquo;t know any more
about canoes than a baby! The Prince of
Whales, that&rsquo;s what you look like!&rdquo; The other
boys joined in laughing at the joke.</p>
<p>Dirk still sat helplessly in the sunken canoe,
his mouth half open. He didn&rsquo;t know a boat
could act like that. His clothes were drenched.
He had thought he was making a brave show,
pushing out boldly in his fine canoe, and now
they were all laughing at him for a lubber.</p>
<p>He scrambled out somehow, and splashed
about in the shallow water, dragging the water-filled
craft to the land beside the rock. A shout
was heard, and a man came galloping down
through the trees. It was Wally Rawn, who had
witnessed the performance from the hillside, but
who had arrived too late to stop it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You there, with the canoe!&rdquo; he hailed.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Van Horn, the Prince of Whales!&rdquo;
put in Brick. &ldquo;Old Sink-Easy, the boy sailor&mdash;that&rsquo;s
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Van Horn,&rdquo; said Wally, looking down
at the sodden, crestfallen figure, &ldquo;stop trying
to pull off that canoe&rsquo;s bottom by dragging it on
those rocks, and listen to me. I could see in a
minute that you don&rsquo;t know the first thing about
a canoe. Where did it come from, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; stammered Dirk. &ldquo;My father
gave it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;mm. Well, before you can go out paddling
in it, you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to treat it.
And you&rsquo;ll have to learn how to step into it
without sinking the poor thing. In the first
place, you ought to know that this is no time for
campers to go boating&mdash;when squad-duty period
is over, and you have reported to whoever is in
charge here at the dock, you might be given
permission to go out. In the second place, no
boy is allowed to take out a canoe unless he has
passed his swimming and boat tests. You
haven&rsquo;t done that, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, sir, I just wanted to try the
canoe and see how it looked in the water&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wally shook his head impatiently. &ldquo;Look
here, Van Horn&mdash;can you swim?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, sir. That is, only a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! This beats me!&rdquo; The councilor
scratched his head, and turned to the other boys.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there anybody here who has any sense?
Here a new boy comes down without a leader,
and without knowing how to swim, puts a canoe
in the water and sinks it under him! Suppose
you had launched it from the end of the dock,
Van Horn, where the deep water is&mdash;what would
you have done if you had gone over then? That&rsquo;s
the reason we have canoe tests&mdash;so a boy won&rsquo;t
go out unless he can take care of himself in the
water, no matter what happens. Now, lift that
canoe on the dock, drain the water out, and leave
it to dry. Then get back to your work. When
we have swimming instruction tomorrow morning,
come down and I&rsquo;ll try to show you how
to swim. It will be several days before you
know enough even to take out a rowboat; but
if you work hard, maybe I can teach you how
to take care of yourself and your canoe. That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo; He turned on his heel and went back to
his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Sheepishly, Dirk obeyed, and with the help of
his grinning comrades, drew the canoe on the
dock and tilted it so that it would drain. Then
Dirk once more waded about, rescuing the drifting
paddles he had lost. At last, dripping and
downcast, he joined the others. Brick looked at
him with a wry grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;re not a sweet sight! It&rsquo;ll be a
long while before your old canoe gets another
bath, believe me. She&rsquo;ll be laid up until you pass
your canoe tests&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t even swim!
The Prince of Whales!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, let him alone, Brick,&rdquo; put in Slim
Yerkes. &ldquo;We should get back and help with
that ice-cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can bet you should! Sax is sure mad.
Well, if the Prince is ready, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The group straggled up through the trees.
Dirk stalked along, saying not a word; but Brick
did not give him a chance to forget his misadventure.
Instead, he kept up a running stream
of ridicule that would have penetrated a skin
much thicker than Dirk&rsquo;s. Something of the
bully still remained in Brick Ryan, even though
he had spent three summers at Lenape; and now
it came out in his words. Besides, he was still
smarting from the punishment he had been given
for his midnight hazing escapade, and he did not
intend to let the despised tattler get off easily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>They skirted the lower corner of the baseball
field, and, crossing the wall, entered the meadow
below the campus. Brick had not stopped jeering
all the while, and now his remarks were growing
more and more cutting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, a baby, that&rsquo;s all you are&mdash;a tattle-tale,
canoe-sinkin&rsquo; baby. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten
what happened last night, and I&rsquo;ll fix you for it,
too, Baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time, Dirk replied to the irksome
words. He stopped, turned, and spoke with his
head up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ryan,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a
mucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick stuck out his chin, and put his hands on
his hips mockingly. &ldquo;Oh, I am, huh? Did you
hear that, boys? F. X. A. Ryan is a mucker!
Dear, dear, it must be true&mdash;the Millionaire
Baby says so! Well, what are you goin&rsquo; to do
about it, Baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk refused to lose his temper. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t
listen to all your talk any longer, that&rsquo;s all.
From now on, please don&rsquo;t speak to me unless
it&rsquo;s necessary. If we can&rsquo;t be friends, we&rsquo;d better
keep apart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear! Now he won&rsquo;t speak to me!
My heart is breakin&rsquo;, boys!&rdquo; Quickly Brick
dropped his mocking tone, and his next words
were threatening. He scowled fiercely into the
face of his enemy. &ldquo;Now, listen, you! I hate
sissies, and I hate tattle-tales, and if you don&rsquo;t
like the way I talk, you may wake up with a
ring around your eye, and a lily in your hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slim Yerkes tried to interpose. &ldquo;Come on,
Brick&mdash;don&rsquo;t pick on him too much. Let&rsquo;s get
back to the lodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick wheeled on the peacemaker. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
lookin&rsquo; for trouble, Slim, and he&rsquo;s more than
likely to get it. I&rsquo;ve got half a mind to poke
him one right now for good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk&rsquo;s eyes flashed. &ldquo;That might not be as
easy as you seem to think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Tough, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; His open hand
darted out swiftly, and unexpectedly shoved
Dirk off his balance. Dirk cried out, caught
himself, and his fists clenched. He was pale save
for two red spots that glowed in his cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Ryan!&rdquo; he said, his lip trembling.
&ldquo;If you really must settle this by
scuffling like a street boy, who&mdash;&mdash; I&rsquo;ll fight
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick&rsquo;s laugh was unpleasant to hear. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
fight! Listen, sissies like you take a chance on
gettin&rsquo; murdered if they talk fight to Brick
Ryan! Why, you mama&rsquo;s boy, I&rsquo;ll knock you
so cold you&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re at the North Pole!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>His words were louder than he thought. From
a tent a hundred yards away, a tousled head appeared,
and shouted something to those within
the tent. &ldquo;Fight! Fight!&rdquo; In no time at all,
the two Utway twins, followed by Al Canning,
had run down from the tent and joined the little
ring of boys from Tent One.</p>
<p>Dirk was silently peeling off his wet gym-shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re really going to go against Brick
Ryan?&rdquo; Slim Yerkes asked in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not to blame,&rdquo; responded Dirk shortly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick, a grim smile on his pugnacious face,
was secretly sizing up the lad whom he had
driven by taunting words to defend himself with
his fists. He was not quite so sure, now, that
Dirk was the sissy he had proclaimed him to be;
those shoulders and arms looked quite husky and
muscular, now that he looked closely. Brick
decided that the thing to do was to pitch in at
once and overpower his opponent from the start.</p>
<p>Jerry Utway was looking around the circle
eagerly. The Utway brothers were never far
away when a scrap arose; it would seem that
they smelled the signs of battle from afar.
&ldquo;Gee, Jake!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;the Van Horn
fellow is going to tackle Brick! I&rsquo;m going to be
his second!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll be Brick&rsquo;s second,&rdquo; responded his
twin. &ldquo;Come on, men, form a ring here. Let&rsquo;s
have this scrap with regular rules. Al, you can
be referee. It&rsquo;s a good thing no leaders are
around to stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al Canning pulled out his watch. &ldquo;Are you
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute more,&rdquo; answered Jake.
&ldquo;Come on, Brick, strip off your shirt. Gosh,
this will be a real fight&mdash;bare knuckles to the
finish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick shook him aside. &ldquo;Aw, I won&rsquo;t need
anything like that. It&rsquo;ll take me just one good
smack to finish this fight. He&rsquo;s a coward.&rdquo; But
inwardly Brick was not so sure. Dirk Van
Horn had said nothing since he had issued his
amazing challenge. He had calmly prepared for
the fray, and stood waiting quietly with no sign
of fear on his set features. He did not cower in
fright, or try to bolster up his courage with a
string of biting words; and there was nothing
amateurish about his pose as he stood with his
clenched fists hanging loosely at his sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; he said in answer to a question
from the eager Jerry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Al. &ldquo;When I say &lsquo;Time!&rsquo;,
you can start. All set? Time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the summons, Brick Ryan plunged forward
over the grassy ground, fists doubled, head
down, and struck a sweeping blow at his enemy.
To his surprise, his flailing arm landed on thin
air. Dirk had side-stepped easily, and still stood
with his arms hanging loosely at his side, his face
still calm.</p>
<p>Brick whirled about and spat. &ldquo;Come on and
fight, will you? None of this duckin&rsquo; like a
snake. And you guys get back, so I can have
some room.&rdquo; He plunged again at his foe, and
aimed a second wide swing at Dirk&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>This time Dirk did not dodge. Instead, he
parried with the palm of his left hand, and his
right fist shot forward, taking the surprised
Brick in the side. It was a stinging blow, and
Brick stepped back with a grunt. He had not
expected this. There were few boys at Lenape
who would dare to stand up against Brick Ryan
even in a friendly bout with gloves; yet here was
the despised Van Horn, the pampered city boy
who couldn&rsquo;t even swim, not only defending
himself skillfully from the Irish lad&rsquo;s attack, but
even striking back!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The blow had made Brick more wary. This
time he did not leap in with his head down&mdash;too
much chance of getting caught off guard again
for those tactics! He circled cautiously, trying
to find an opening where a thrust would do most
good. His anger was rising, too. The breathless
watchers looked at his face, and waited
awestricken for the terrible moment when the
aroused Brick Ryan would wade in and demolish
his daring opponent.</p>
<p>Jerry Utway, his eyes ablaze with excitement,
jumped up and down, urging his champion with
delighted cries. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the boy, Van Horn,
old scout! Wade in and tap him one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Jerry!&rdquo; his brother Jake put in.
&ldquo;Let them alone, or there&rsquo;ll be two fights going
on here! Whee, look at that one! Go it, Brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick was again in the lists, this time depending
upon speed and the violent fury of his attack.
It seemed to the onlookers that no one could long
withstand the force of his charge; his arms
whirled and jabbed, and his face was red with
the exertion of his onslaught. Indeed, Van
Horn was quickly driven backwards, and more
than once a doubled fist made its red mark on
his naked chest. But he still kept his feet, and
although he was given no chance to take the
offensive, he guarded his face skillfully. Yet
slowly he gave ground; Brick had maneuvered
about until he was above where the other stood,
and was driving him down the sloping hillside.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Nig Jackson gave vent to a yell. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got
him now! Go it, Brick! Wow, he&rsquo;s down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al Canning, in his capacity as referee, rushed
forward. Dirk was sprawled out upon the uneven
ground, crouched on one side. His face
was whiter than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slipped on some grass,&rdquo; he mumbled through
swollen lips. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo; Unaided, he
staggered to his feet, and looked about in a dazed
way. Brick, who had stepped aside when his
foe had fallen, now advanced confidently for the
final sortie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finish him off, Brick!&rdquo; yelled Eddie Scolter.
Ryan, encouraged by the shouts of the
watchers, marched slowly and triumphantly to a
stand just beyond arm&rsquo;s length of where Dirk
stood, dazedly shaking the sweat from his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had enough?&rdquo; Brick taunted. His blows
had taken effect in more than one place on Dirk&rsquo;s
face and body, and one shoulder was badly
scraped by his fall. But Brick himself did not
go unmarked from the fray; his cheek was coloring
where a clenched fist had got through his
guard, and his right arm was weak from panting
effort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Dirk Van Horn clenched his teeth without
answering. For an instant, the watching boys
saw a stab of fury flare up in his dark eyes. He
set his feet, held his head high, and his arms
swung into the guard position.</p>
<p>Brick advanced still one further step. &ldquo;Had
enough, Baby? I won&rsquo;t ask you again. If
you&rsquo;ll apologize, I won&rsquo;t hurt you any more
today&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was too close for his own safety. Dirk
grunted as he shot his arm forward in a telling
blow straight from the shoulder. His bunched
knuckles caught the surprised Brick on the point
of the jaw.</p>
<p>A ludicrous look of amazement came over
Brick Ryan&rsquo;s face. For an instant he tottered,
grinning stupidly at the staring circle of boys;
then, with a soft groan, he slid backward, his
knees gave way gently, and he slumped senseless
upon the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE RED HAND REVENGERS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Ten!&rdquo; counted Al Canning. &ldquo;Van Horn
wins with a sweet knockout!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay, Handsome Van, the K. O. Kid!&rdquo; cried
Jerry Utway, hammering his champion upon the
back. &ldquo;Gee, what a beautiful swat that was!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan opened his eyes. His head was
still spinning from the force of the blow that
had vanquished him. As through a mist he
could see the dim faces of the boys about his
prostrate form. Among them stood out the
triumphant, smiling features of Dirk Van Horn.</p>
<p>A hand shook his shoulder, and Jake Utway
spoke in his ear. &ldquo;Are you all right now, Brick?
Tough luck. He sure packs a wallop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick tried to grin, and groaned in spite of
himself. His jaw still ached mightily where his
antagonist&rsquo;s doubled fist had struck, and his
swollen lower lip was bleeding slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to hand it to him,&rdquo; he mumbled, and
with Jake&rsquo;s help clambered unsteadily to his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gollies, how did he do it? It was as clean a
knockout as I ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you were asking for it,&rdquo; observed Slim
Yerkes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I was.&rdquo; Brick smiled ruefully.
&ldquo;Van Horn, I guess we&rsquo;ve been gettin&rsquo; each
other wrong. There may be some things about
campin&rsquo; that you don&rsquo;t know, but when it comes
to scrappin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;! Say, you beat me square, but
I don&rsquo;t hold any grudge. From now on, let&rsquo;s
forget everything and be friends. What do you
say?&rdquo; He held out his hand in a frank gesture.</p>
<p>Dirk looked at the outstretched hand, and his
lip curled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ryan,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;I said you
were a mucker, and I still think so. Any time
you want another boxing lesson, come around.
Otherwise, kindly keep to your own affairs and
leave me to mine.&rdquo; He pointedly turned his
back, picked up his wet shirt, and stalked off up
the path to the lodge.</p>
<p>Brick bit his lip, and his hand dropped with
an angry gesture to his side; but he said nothing.
Jerry Utway left the group and ran after Dirk,
catching up with him and walking at a fast pace
by his side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Van, will you show me some time how
you made that knockout? I want to try it out
on my brother next time we have a row. Gee,
if anybody had told me you could put out Brick
Ryan&rsquo;s lights, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it!
Where did you learn how to fight like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has seen to it that I had the best
boxing lessons that money could buy.&rdquo; Dirk
smiled grimly. &ldquo;Yesterday Ryan seemed to
think that having money wasn&rsquo;t of much value;
but I hope that now he has learned that scientific
self-defense is a good thing to acquire. And
because my father could pay for those boxing
lessons, I don&rsquo;t have to be bullied by any street-boy
that comes along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure did make Brick sit up and take
notice,&rdquo; chuckled Jerry. &ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you
make up with him afterward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so easy. He hazed me pretty badly
last night, and I&rsquo;m not done with him yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Brick is a pretty good fellow when you
get to know him. Why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Jerry
broke off, and cocked his ear as bugle-notes rattled
down from the porch of the lodge. &ldquo;Say,
we better hurry&mdash;there goes Church Call.&rdquo; He
glanced with amusement at the battered features
and wet, stained garments of the boy at his side.
&ldquo;Gosh, you sure are a sight! You and Brick
Ryan will look like a swell pair, sitting on a
bench together at church this morning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Dirk was quite late for church. He went to
the empty tent, washed, and changed his wet
clothing for garments more suitable for Sunday
service; and the hour of camp worship was more
than half over by the time he slipped into a log
seat in the woodland chapel overlooking the lake.
Brick was down at the front with the rest of the
complement of Tent One, but did not turn his
head. One or two boys near by looked at Dirk&rsquo;s
marked face curiously, and Jake Utway once
caught his eye, winked, and grinned from behind
a hymn-book.</p>
<p>During the bountiful Sunday dinner in the
lodge, Dirk, sitting with his councilor on one side
of him and Nig Jackson on the other, intercepted
many inquiring glances directed from
neighboring tables toward himself and Brick
Ryan. The red-headed boy, for his part, ate
with his head down, saying nothing. If Sax
McNulty had heard of the fight, he gave no sign.</p>
<p>When dessert was served, Sax looked whimsically
at the plate of ice-cream before him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your consciences ought to hurt you
slackers,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;If Lefty hadn&rsquo;t stuck
to his guns, the camp would be missing their ice-cream
today, all right. I&rsquo;ve never had my squad
sneak out on a job before. What do you fellows
think about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn felt the leader&rsquo;s eyes upon
him. He flushed and tried to look unconcerned;
but the ice-cream, for some reason, stuck in his
throat, and he soon pushed the plate away, to
melt into a shapeless mass.</p>
<p>When the time came for announcements, Dr.
Cannon, who was officer of the day, awarded the
pennant for highest points in inspection to Wally
Rawn&rsquo;s tent; then, with a grin, marched over to
the Tent One table and, amid the good-natured
jeers of the assembled campers, presented a
different sort of emblem. It was a big tin oil-can,
across which was printed in white letters:
&ldquo;Booby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tent One wins the Goof Loving Cup,&rdquo; the
doctor announced with a flourish, &ldquo;for being
lowest in honor points for today. And the first
shall be last!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for, Sax?&rdquo; Eddie Scolter asked,
pointing to the strange object.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;It means we have to hang that up on our
tent-pole in full sight, so everybody in camp can
see we&rsquo;re a bunch of dubs,&rdquo; explained the leader,
with a glance around the table. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
just what we&rsquo;ve been today. Van Horn, you
may have the privilege of carrying this little
token down to the tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk opened his mouth to protest, but the
whistle sounded just then, and the campers
leaped to their feet and began pouring out the
doors. Picking up the loathed booby-can, Dirk
started walking down toward the tent. He had
not gone far when he felt a hand on his arm, and
he looked up, frowning, to see Sax McNulty&rsquo;s
serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything at the table just now,&rdquo;
began the leader, &ldquo;but of course you know
you&rsquo;re to blame for most of our demerits today.
I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not getting off to a very good
start at Lenape, Van.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why blame me for everything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t, exactly. The other fellows
should have known better than to drop their duty
and help you launch your canoe this morning&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ll have to admit you were the main cause
of it. Then, Wally Rawn told me about your
fool stunt at the lake. Also, and moreover, when
the inspection staff came around this noon, our
tent was cluttered up with your things strewn
all over the place, wet clothes dumped on the
floor&mdash;plenty demerits. You&rsquo;ll have to learn not
to do the first thing that enters your head, Van
Horn&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to think of the other fellow,
and consider what will be for the good of the
camp and your own gang. I haven&rsquo;t mentioned
anything about your fight with Ryan, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He started that!&rdquo; retorted Dirk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t interfere there,&rdquo; promised McNulty
gently. &ldquo;Ryan is a decent chap, and so are you;
and I know that after a couple of days you will
get along together fine. Try to get his point of
view. We&rsquo;ve got a fine bunch of fellows in Tent
One this time, and as soon as we get to pulling
together, we&rsquo;re going to show Lenape some
speed! I didn&rsquo;t mean to make you listen to another
sermon today,&rdquo; he ended wryly, &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t expect you to learn everything about camping
in a few hours. Come to me next time you
feel the urge to do something startling, and I&rsquo;ll
try to put you wise first.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Dirk smarted under the words, but held back
the bitter reply that rose to his lips. He
slammed the booby-can on a nail sticking into
the front tent-pole, and retired sulkily to his
untidy bunk. The other boys, with the exception
of the two who were doing the dishes,
were stretched about, taking a restful siesta after
their bountiful dinner. Across from Dirk sat
Brick Ryan, busied as usual over his life-saving
manual, and apparently unaware that there was
anybody named Van Horn within a thousand
miles of him. For the first time, Dirk noticed
that Brick wore a curious insignia stitched to the
front of his jersey. It was outlined in green and
white, and showed a large L superimposed upon
a swastika. Dirk&rsquo;s eyes passed to Lefty Reardon.
Lefty also wore the green L.</p>
<p>Dirk decided that the camp monogram would
look most attractive on one of his sweaters. He
jumped up, and hurried back to the lodge before
the small camp store closed.</p>
<p>On the porch of the lodge, a short string of
boys stood before the window, waiting their turn
to make small purchases of candy, peanuts, and
gum. Dirk joined the end of the line. When
he came abreast of the window, he issued his
demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want one of those camp letters to put on
my sweater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long Jim Avery, the lanky councilor charged
with the duty of looking after the camp supplies,
leaned far over the counter and looked at the boy
with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want what?&rdquo; he asked with widening
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean, sir&mdash;one of
those green and white things with an L on them.
I want to buy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy in back of Dirk snickered. Long Jim
gulped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s trying to play a joke on you,
Van Horn. Why, I thought even a new boy
knew that you can&rsquo;t buy an honor emblem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk flushed. &ldquo;But&mdash;some of the chaps have
them. Where do you get them, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, my! You can&rsquo;t buy one&mdash;you have to
earn it, and then it&rsquo;s awarded to you at Council
Ring. That&rsquo;s a good one! Why, before you
have the right to wear an honor emblem, you
have to pass a lot of tests&mdash;you have to know a
bunch of trees and birds and flowers and rocks
and stars, and how to swim and handle a boat,
and hike and cook and build woodcraft objects,
and&mdash;oh, lots of things! Here, I&rsquo;ll get you a
card with all the requirements printed on it, and
when you pass a test, the leader who passes you
will put his initials down. Campers have a
chance to pass the tests all the time. If I can
help you learn some of the things, come around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; stammered Dirk miserably,
backing away. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;&mdash; I guess I
don&rsquo;t want to start in right now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>He stumbled off down the steps. They were
making fun of him again! The boys would
spread the story around&mdash;how he had tried to
buy an honor emblem at the store&mdash;and soon the
whole camp would be laughing at his latest fool
stunt! No matter what he started to do at
Lenape, it always turned out to be the wrong
thing! Now McNulty would have more of his
comments to make!</p>
<p>Dirk was feeling very sorry for himself. Tears
of helpless rage welled into his eyes, and he did
not see that someone was standing in front of
him until he heard his name called in a mysterious
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Psst! Van Horn! Say, I want to see you
a second!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk looked up. The speaker was a runty-looking
boy with a large nose and close-set black
eyes. He took Dirk&rsquo;s arm with a familiar gesture,
and patted him on the back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I want to tell you. I heard about how
you licked Red Ryan. Gee, that was swell! I
wish I&rsquo;d seen you do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know about it?&rdquo; asked Dirk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everybody in camp knows about it!
You&rsquo;re a hero, that&rsquo;s what you are! A real tough
fighter, you must be! There are lots of guys in
this camp that don&rsquo;t like Ryan, and are glad he
got it good at last! Say, we don&rsquo;t want anybody
to notice I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; to you, see? Come on, duck
in here and I&rsquo;ll tell you somethin&rsquo; real important!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want? Why can&rsquo;t you tell me
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too secret, see? Quick&mdash;slide in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk, fearing some new pitfall, followed suspiciously;
but the mysterious manner of the big-nosed
little fellow impressed him in spite of
himself, and he allowed himself to be drawn
under the shadow of the overhanging porch of
the lodge. Here several small rooms had been
built&mdash;a dark-room for the convenience of the
camp photographers, and a larger compartment
in which were stored trunks, suitcases, old tents,
and the like. Through the door of the latter
room he followed his guide, who shut that door
carefully and then sat on a pile of lumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk too loud, see?&rdquo; he warned Dirk.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want nobody to guess what we&rsquo;re
after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what are you after anyway?&rdquo; Dirk
asked impatiently. &ldquo;Who are you, and why are
you acting so mysterious about everything?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Blum,&rdquo; the other whispered
hoarsely. &ldquo;&lsquo;Dumb&rsquo; Blum, the guys call me,
but that&rsquo;s only a nickname&mdash;I&rsquo;m not so dumb as
most people think. Now, listen. You&rsquo;ve got it
in for Brick Ryan, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t got along together so far.
But what has that to do with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see! And you don&rsquo;t like Sax McNulty
any too well, do you? He bawled you out
pretty heavy a little while ago, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know lots of things!&rdquo; the other chuckled.
&ldquo;Some people in this camp are not treatin&rsquo; you
right, Van! But me and some other guys can
see what a swell feller you are, and we&rsquo;re ready
to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to do what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenge! That&rsquo;s what! How would you
like it if you could get back at everybody that
ever does anything to you around here? Brick
Ryan, for instance&mdash;if somethin&rsquo; pretty terrible
happened to him, nobody would guess who done
it; but you could laugh up your sleeve all the
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk looked puzzled. &ldquo;What are you driving
at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A malicious laugh answered him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;I got a gang. We do pretty well what we
like around this camp, and if anybody don&rsquo;t like
it&mdash;even leaders, or even the Chief himself&mdash;why,
they&rsquo;re good and sorry for it! We have meetings
in the middle of the night, and we sign the
oath with our own blood, and swear that if anybody
hurts any one of us, why, we get revenge!
We go under the secret name of the Red Hand
Revengers, and we want you to join with us,
see?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">SHENANIGANS FOR BRICK</span></h2>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t seem a bad idea, the way Blum put
it. The Red Hand Revengers, with their
mysterious meetings in the dead of night, their
oaths of blood brotherhood, and their secret
signs and deeds of vengeance against those who
thwarted them, sounded most exciting. Even
before the leader of this mystic society had finished
speaking, Dirk Van Horn had made up
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;What do I have
to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won&rsquo;t need to be initiated,&rdquo; Blum
assured him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have our first meeting tonight
after taps, and you can meet the rest of

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I swear.&rdquo;</p>

know! How about Iron Gauntlet, on account
of the way you knocked out Brick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. That sounds splendid. And I&rsquo;ll
bring a watermelon to the meeting tonight. My
father brought it up to give to the other fellows
in the tent, but they don&rsquo;t deserve it. And
listen&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write home and have my mother send up
a big box of cake and candy and stuff, just for
the Revengers!&rdquo; said Dirk. &ldquo;And when they let
me use my canoe, we&rsquo;ll all go out in it, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; objected Blum. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget we
mustn&rsquo;t be seen together! When I want to get
in touch with you, I&rsquo;ll leave a note under your
pillow. Now, we&rsquo;ll have to separate pretty
quick. I&rsquo;ll get you when everybody is asleep tonight,
and we&rsquo;ll have our first meeting. You
stay here a couple minutes after I leave, so
nobody will guess what we&rsquo;re up to. And right
today, Iron Gauntlet, old revenger, we&rsquo;ll start
putting the Red Curse on that varlet Brick
Ryan!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Blum, master of the sinister Red Hand, tip-toed
to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long, Headless Green Dragon!&rdquo; Dirk
whispered after him.</p>
<p>That night Brick Ryan returned from Indian
Council Ring to find the first of his troubles
upon him. The campers had been summoned to
their quarters after an evening spent about the
four-square fire of friendship, and by the light of
the tent lantern, the inhabitants of Tent One
were undressing for the night. Brick Ryan
slipped into his pajamas and turned down his
blankets, ready to jump in. An angry cry
escaped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Brick?&rdquo; asked Lefty
Reardon sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s hashed my bunk, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;
the Irish boy exclaimed. &ldquo;Look there, will you?
The whole bed is stuck full of cockleburrs! I
can&rsquo;t sleep in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; said his friend sympathetically.
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll help you pull &rsquo;em out.
Sax will be back in a few minutes&mdash;why don&rsquo;t
you tell him about it? What a dirty trick to
play on a fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>&ldquo;If I knew who did it, I sure wouldn&rsquo;t have
to tell a leader about it!&rdquo; said Brick through
clenched teeth. He looked about in the dull light
at the faces of his mates. All of them looked
innocent; Dirk Van Horn looked suspiciously
so, and there was a faint trace of a smile on
his good-looking features. Could Van Horn
have&mdash;&mdash;? But the heartless trick must have
been done during Council, and Dirk had been
sitting in his place every moment of the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must have it in for you, Brick,&rdquo;
commented Lefty as the two bent over the blankets
and began pulling out the prickly burrs with
which they were covered. &ldquo;Gee, this is going
to be a long, slow job. Who do you suppose
hates you so much that he&rsquo;d do a mean thing
like this to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Brick. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
sure going to find out, and when I do, you can
bet he&rsquo;ll get paid back for his low, sneaking
work!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Brick slept but poorly that night, for it had
been impossible to remove all the sharp, pin-like
burrs with which his blankets had been coated.
He tossed and turned, and kept finding new
spines that had penetrated through the woolen
mass to irritate him. Muttering to himself, he
at last drifted off to sleep. Later, he awoke for
a moment, and looked across the tent, where
some unseen person was crawling back into his
bunk; but he thought nothing of it, and in the
morning had forgotten all about it.</p>
<p>The morning was cloudy, and a cool wind
swept down from the northeast. When Brick
piled out of his uncomfortable bedclothes at
Reveille, he thrust his feet into his shoes, as usual.
But the state of those shoes was far from usual.
Brick let out a yell of rage. His shoes were
brim-full of icy water, and the strings were
knotted a dozen times. He had to hurry to
setting-up drill barefoot over the rough ground;
and to crown it all, his bathrobe was missing, and
he shivered in the raw breeze until he caught
sight of the garment hung in a pine tree far
below the parade ground. And he found that
when he went to brush his teeth before breakfast,
his tooth-paste tube had been stuffed with soap;
but he did not find out until his mouth was burning
with the choking stuff, and he was frothing
and blowing sudsy bubbles, much to the delight
of two small boys who scrubbed away beside him.
He washed out his mouth, but the vile taste
remained until long after the morning meal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>Brick began to wonder if he were bewitched.
What was the meaning of this series of afflictions?
He could find no trace of whoever had
committed these acts. If it was Dirk Van Horn,
he covered it up pretty well. Besides, why
should Van Horn resort to such stealthy tricks,
the acts of a cowardly soul? Van Horn had
fought him the day before, and won fairly; why
should he now begin a campaign of cockleburrs,
watered shoes, and soapy tooth-paste?</p>
<p>The bewildered Brick spoke to his friend
Lefty about it when the two were walking up
from morning swim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I got back after breakfast, I
found a big hoptoad in my clothes locker,&rdquo; he
concluded, &ldquo;and nobody was around but a little
kid from Tent Seven. Who do you suppose it
can be, Lefty? How long will it go on? I
swear, I&rsquo;m about ready to soak somebody in the
nose if I catch him getting into my things. Am
I haunted, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are,&rdquo; agreed Lefty promptly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
haunted by some sneaking coward who is trying
to get your goat. Van Horn fought you fair
yesterday, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he went on in a matter-of-fact
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. I didn&rsquo;t mind that. But the Millionaire
Baby, although he has some crazy ideas,
wouldn&rsquo;t stoop to those tricks, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;If he did, he wouldn&rsquo;t stand a show of getting
on the baseball team, Shawnee game or no
Shawnee game,&rdquo; said Lefty. &ldquo;As long as I&rsquo;m
captain, we&rsquo;ll have only square-shooters playing
for Lenape. You comin&rsquo; down for practice this
afternoon, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet, if my glove hasn&rsquo;t been stolen by
that time. I swear, Lefty, I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; so I&rsquo;m
scared to turn around, for fear somebody will
swipe my pants when I&rsquo;m not lookin&rsquo;! But,
say, do you think this Van Horn guy is really
baseball material?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty shrugged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try him out. Goodness
knows we can&rsquo;t pass up any promising
players, when we only have today and tomorrow
to get ready for the Shawnee game. I hear
Shawnee has got back Hook Bollard and Widelle
this year, and that catcher of theirs&mdash;what&rsquo;s his
name?&mdash;that made three runs last time we played
them. If Lenape wants to take the best end of
the score on Wednesday, we&rsquo;ve got to show some
steam!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>When the announcements were made at lunch,
Lefty Reardon rose and read a list of names of
the campers who had been chosen to form the
team that would defend Lenape&rsquo;s honor on the
baseball diamond on the following Wednesday.
On that day, the whole of Lenape would trek
northward to the shores of Iron Lake for a visit
to their rival, Camp Shawnee. The crowning
event of the day would be a ball game between
the two camp teams, thus renewing a yearly
custom of friendly sportsmanship. Lenape had
been badly beaten the season before, and among
the campers there was much talk of the coming
encounter, and predictions that this time they
would pay back the old score with a rousing victory.</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn noted with disappointment
that his name was not among those called; but
no sooner had Lefty seated himself than he
turned to Dirk and said: &ldquo;Say, Van, I hear
you&rsquo;re supposed to be a fielder. If you want to
come down to the diamond with the rest of the
team, we&rsquo;ll try you out and see if we can find a
place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, try out!&rdquo; urged Sax McNulty. &ldquo;You
were on your prep school team, weren&rsquo;t you,
Van?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Dirk nodded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down, sir.&rdquo; He had
spent the morning lolling in his bunk with a
book of stories, and had disregarded Wally
Rawn&rsquo;s offer to teach him to swim. Neither had
he made any move to join in the many other
activities of the camp routine. But baseball was
different, he felt; he knew and liked that sport
best of all, and had little doubt that with his
school training, he could hold a position on a
scratch team such as he thought the Lenape
squad to be.</p>
<p>When the bugle sounded recall, Dirk, resplendent
in a brand-new baseball suit and bearing
a well-oiled glove under his arm, sauntered
down to the field and reported to Captain Reardon,
who with Kipper Dabney was warming up
a few curves. Lefty slammed a sizzling drop
into Gil Shelton&rsquo;s padded mitt, and turned to
Dirk with a nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get out there with the bunch and
get under a few of those fungoes that Mullins
is knocking,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;and show us what
you can do. Later on, we&rsquo;ll have batting practice
and you&rsquo;ll have a chance to prove you can
hit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk, with a confident smile, trotted out into
the tall grass behind third base, and for half an
hour, in company with Ollie Steffins, Blackie
Thorne, and a youngster named Tompkins, he
fielded lofty flies and grounders from Soapy
Mullins&rsquo; resounding bat. Now and then he
glanced at the other members of the squad. The
infielders were tossing the ball back and forth
with easy skill, and Brick Ryan, hovering over
first base, missed few of the shots that came near
his post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>When the players were warmed up sufficiently,
they lined up one after another to face the
delivery of Captain Lefty and his relief pitcher,
Dabney. At last it came Dirk&rsquo;s turn. He
selected a bat and approached the plate with a
cocky grin. Lefty, noting his short grip, thought
to teach this arrogant newcomer a little lesson,
and slipped over a neat inshoot that took him
up short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike!&rdquo; called out Lieutenant Eames,
whose service on the West Point team qualified
him as volunteer umpire.</p>
<p>Dirk did not lengthen his grip; but when
Lefty sought to repeat his trick, he was ready
for it. As the whirling ball neared the plate,
Dirk stepped back a pace and his levelled bat
met the horsehide smartly. A clean single flew
through the infield well inside the lines and
through the fingers of Ken Haveland, who was
covering the domain of shortstop. The few
scattered spectators set up a quick shout of
approval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>When the period of practice was over, Lefty
announced that there would be a short game with
a team of leaders the following afternoon; and
the players strolled in twos and threes back to
their tents to prepare for swim. Lefty, on his
way to the lodge burdened with bats and other
equipment, found Brick Ryan sitting on a bench
under a huge black cherry tree at the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so thoughtful?&rdquo; Lefty hailed him.
&ldquo;And by the way, where were you for batting
practice? You slipped off without telling me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had an idea,&rdquo; responded his friend grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;and it gave you a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it gave somebody else an ache, but not
in the head. I put a stop to all these shenanigans
that have been raisin&rsquo; cain with my belongin&rsquo;s&mdash;at
least, I put a stop to them for a while, anyway.
I sneaked up on Tent One durin&rsquo; battin&rsquo;
practice. Not a soul was around, except that
nasty little Toby brat from Tent Eight. Do
you know, I caught him in the very act of
dumpin&rsquo; a pail of water right on my bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I spanked him, Lefty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would he do that for? What&rsquo;s he
got against you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing that I know of. It&rsquo;s a mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Lefty threw back his head and laughed.
&ldquo;Better not let young Sherlock Jones hear
about it,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll pester around with
clues until he&rsquo;s dizzy. Well, I&rsquo;m glad Van Horn
didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it. He was
down at the field all the while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s stretchin&rsquo; his bunk right now,
readin&rsquo; bedtime stories. How did he look in
there today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad. He&rsquo;s a better fielder than Terry
Tompkins, that&rsquo;s sure. And he&rsquo;s fairly brainy
with a bat. Tomorrow we can see what he can
do against the councilors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty picked up his equipment and started on.
He had only gone a few paces when Brick, who
had not moved, called after him in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, my son, what do you guess is the
meanin&rsquo; of R.H.R.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lefty considered. &ldquo;Why, it might be Red-Hot
Rhubarb, or Right-Handed Rattlesnake, or
anything. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; muttered Brick. &ldquo;But maybe tonight
I&rsquo;ll find out, and if I do, Lefty me boy,
I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">DIRK HEARS OF THE LONG TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Six masked figures sat with their heads together
in the starlight of the deserted Council
Ring. It was late. Two hours gone, Camp
Lenape had retired to a rest welcome and well-earned.
But here in this lonely spot, their presence
unknown to their fellows and councilors,
the mysterious six plotted mischief. In the
shadow of the tall stone seat of the Chief, on the
north side of the ring, they crouched, listening to
the graveyard tones of their undersized leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Revengers, we will now have a
report from the Stealthy Stabber. He&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
tell us all about the Ryan Curse affair, see?
Speak up, Stabber!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He walloped me!&rdquo; spoke up a shrill voice,
more whimpering than bloodthirsty, and the
little fellow rubbed himself tenderly at the painful
memory.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;And served you right, too!&rdquo; put in a third
Revenger. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were going as
far as you did. I think it was a bunch of
cowardly tricks&mdash;soaping up his tooth-paste and
trying to soak his blankets with a pail of water&mdash;and
if I had known, I wouldn&rsquo;t have let it
happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, say, Iron Gauntlet, old fellow,&rdquo; whined
the leader; &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to back out like that,
are you? Why, Stabber and Red Rover and the
rest of us only did all this stuff to help you out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need that sort of help, thank you,&rdquo;
replied Iron Gauntlet, settling back in his place.
&ldquo;It was mean, and from now on I want to tell
you that I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried a small lad to his right,
starting up in his place and listening fearfully.
The leader laughed sneeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get scared, kid. Ain&rsquo;t the Headless
Green Dragon here to protect you? That was
only an owl hootin&rsquo;. Gee, you guys are sure a
bunch of babies. A fine gang of Revengers you
turned out to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it sounded pretty terrible, Dumb,&rdquo; muttered
the lad, shivering. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it here in
the woods&mdash;it&rsquo;s too spooky! Suppose a bear or
something came after us!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Dumb Blum laughed again. &ldquo;No bears
around here. And even if there was, I guess
they wouldn&rsquo;t bother me! Now, we got to figure
what to do next. If Iron Gauntlet here thinks
we ought to lay off Brick Ryan for a while, why,
there&rsquo;s lot of other varlets around camp we could
torture&mdash;&mdash; Ooh! Look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bold master of the dread secret society
pointed a shaking hand. His small followers fell
back, several of them squealing with terror.</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn looked in the direction at
which Blum was fearfully pointing. Above the
stone dais of the Chief before them rose a horrible
shapeless form, gleaming with unearthly
fire. Slowly, as they watched, rooted to the spot,
the monster stirred, the folds of its skin glowing
with a pale green luminescence, and uttered at
the horrified boys a sepulchral bellow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Green Dragon!&rdquo; babbled the
Stealthy Stabber, with chattering teeth.</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, the gaping mouth of the
creature yawned open. A fizzing spurt of yellow
sparks darted from the cavity. With a blinding
flash, a ball of crimson fire shot out at them,
throwing a bloody glow over the scene. The
horror was coming after them, belching flame
and smoke!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Another ball of fire, this time a deathlike blue
in color, burst in their midst. Without a further
glance, the terrified youngsters took to their
heels and ran through the underbrush, stumbling,
falling, crying out as they fled from that ghastly
spot. Far in the van was the doughty Blum,
almost out of his head with fear, racing as though
that glowing green devil was right at his heels!</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn had risen to his feet, and had
backed away from the oncoming monster. He
could flee no further; his legs were weak with
fright; his back was braced against the towering
totem-pole of the Lenape tribe; and his teeth
were clenched to keep himself from crying out.
Straight toward him shambled the glowing
shape, showering many-colored sparks as it came!</p>
<p>He stared petrified. The dragon paused in
the center of the ring, shot forth a final rain of
sparks, and collapsed to the ground, its phosphorescent
hide thrown back. From within its
folds rose a high-pitched, mocking laugh that
was harder for Dirk to bear than the blood-curdling
groans it had formerly given forth.</p>
<p>That laugh! Dirk drew out his forgotten
flashlight, and snapped the button. A ray of
light shot out, and revealed Brick Ryan, rolling
on the ground in a tempest of mirth, clutching
in one hand a smoking thick tube of paper. At
his side lay the cast-off skin of the &ldquo;dragon&rdquo;
that had put to rout the brave band of Red
Revengers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Always Brick Ryan! Dirk sank limply to a
seat, and put his head in his hands. The shock
had been greater than he thought.</p>
<p>Brick, still chuckling, rose and came toward
him. &ldquo;Gollies! Did you see those bold lads run
for it! They won&rsquo;t stop until they&rsquo;re safe in bed
with the covers pulled over their heads! And
nothin&rsquo; after them but F. X. A. Ryan wrapped
up in an old piece of canvas rubbed with phosphorus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that terrible fire&mdash;those lights&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
murmured Dirk. &ldquo;Why&mdash;how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick burst into another peal of laughter.
&ldquo;Just a little old Roman candle left over from
the Fourth of July! And in case you want to
know how I found out what was up, I discovered
a bit of a note under your pillow this afternoon,
tellin&rsquo; all about your fine meetin&rsquo; and how you
were goin&rsquo; to fix Ryan for keeps. But when
Ryan came himself to see these brave laddies,
they scooted like the pack of rabbits they are!
Revengers! Huh! Dumb Blum and his gang of
babies may be all right for sneakin&rsquo; around and
messin&rsquo; up a fellow&rsquo;s things, but they sure aren&rsquo;t
very happy out here in the woods at night!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Dirk lifted his head wearily. &ldquo;I wanted to
speak to you about that, Ryan. I didn&rsquo;t know
they were going to fill your shoes with water
and steal your things, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have stood
for it. Those were coward&rsquo;s tricks; and I want
you to know I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bein&rsquo; sorry won&rsquo;t help you much. Maybe I
believe you, and maybe I don&rsquo;t; but anyways,
you were out here with that bunch, cookin&rsquo; up
trouble, and you sure looked pretty cheap. Blum
was tryin&rsquo; to get you to do his dirty work, and
he&rsquo;s such a coward himself he has to pull this
secret society stuff and make little kids that
don&rsquo;t know any better follow him around like he
was somebody, the nasty little brat. So that&rsquo;s
the kind of a friend you pick, huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk sighed. &ldquo;I said I was in the wrong,
Ryan, and I apologized. I&rsquo;m sorry I got mixed
up in this affair. What else can I say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said enough, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.
Now, unless we both get back to Tent One
pretty quick, you and I will be spendin&rsquo; tomorrow
on the wood-pile. Those scared kids have
probably wakened up the whole camp.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Dirk nodded, rising to his feet. &ldquo;But before
we go, Ryan, tell me just one thing. I&mdash;I guess
I&rsquo;m not the right sort of chap to get along here
at Lenape. I try to do the right thing, but I
always seem to end up in trouble. Tell me, what
is the matter with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick, taken aback at the other&rsquo;s frankness,
looked at the ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no preacher,&rdquo; he
mumbled slowly. &ldquo;When&mdash;when I first came to
Lenape, I guess I was just as bad as you, and
a lot worse. And maybe my trouble was the
same as yours. I was always thinkin&rsquo; first of
Brick Ryan, and never stoppin&rsquo; to wonder how
it struck the other fellow. Then one of the
leaders got me to see that I could get most fun
out of campin&rsquo; by doin&rsquo; things for Lenape instead
of bein&rsquo; selfish and tryin&rsquo; to show how
smart a guy F. X. A. Ryan was. I&mdash;I guess
that&rsquo;s what they mean when they talk of camp
spirit,&rdquo; he ended lamely; &ldquo;thinkin&rsquo; about the
good of the crowd instead of just showin&rsquo; off for
your own benefit. Now, let&rsquo;s get along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash; Say!&rdquo; cried Dirk with
glowing eyes, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to do something for the
camp! No, I don&rsquo;t mean asking my father for
some money and buying stuff for everybody to
use. I mean, well&mdash;if we won that baseball game
Wednesday, I guess it would be a thing to be
proud of! Ryan, I&rsquo;m going to play as I never
played before&mdash;for the honor of the camp!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a starter,&rdquo; Brick admitted.
&ldquo;Now, for gosh sakes, let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two made their way back to their bunks
without mishap, and turned in to take a much-needed
sleep. However, before he shut his eyes
for good, Dirk pondered over the events of the
night; and he decided that he would not forget
the advice that his red-haired tent-mate had offered
him in the Council Ring.</p>
<p>Next morning, as Dirk was racing down to
Indian Dip in the sparkling lake along with the
rest of the newly-risen campers, he found Dumb
Blum at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what happened last night, anyway?&rdquo;
asked the erstwhile leader of the Revengers.
&ldquo;Did that thing catch you, or what? What was
it, Van?&rdquo; he asked with Wide eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Brick Ryan,&rdquo; Dirk replied; and
ignoring the other&rsquo;s cry of amazement, went on:
&ldquo;He made me realize what a silly thing we were
doing, having a secret society and all that foolishness.
Listen, Blum; I think you&rsquo;re a coward,
and if I find out that you and your friends are
having any more meetings of your absurd
R.H.R., I promise I&rsquo;ll make you regret it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He clenched his fist, and Blum, his jaw dropping,
backed off hastily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have anything to do with it!&rdquo; he
promised. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit me, Van Horn!&rdquo; He
fell back, and Dirk, unmindful, trotted down to
the dock, leaving the despised Blum far in the
rear.</p>
<p>That afternoon the promised game with the
councilors kept the Lenape team on the jump to
defend their positions against prime competition.
With Lieutenant Eames on the mound for the
leaders, and Chief himself, in mask and chest-protector,
behind the plate, the camper squad
were hard put to it to score. However, Soapy
Mullins got home on a two-bagger made by
Lefty Reardon, and in the fifth inning, which
was by agreement the last, Blackie Thorne surprised
himself as much as the others by hitting
a long fly that landed among the rocks of the
stone fence, and was not found until he had
completed a tour of the bases for the second
tally. But when the leaders came up for the last
time, they began a merry procession that ended
only with Swim Call, leaving the final score 5-2
in favor of the councilors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had us going for a while, Captain,&rdquo; the
Chief called to Lefty as the game ended. &ldquo;If
your team plays as well on Wednesday, Shawnee
will have to use ten men to beat you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Chief,&rdquo; responded the pitcher, with
a grin. &ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t be a cinch by any means.
They have the toughest outfit this year they&rsquo;ve
ever had, and I&rsquo;m sure going into the box with
my pockets full of four-leaf clovers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the game had not been a victory for
the camper team, it had ended happily for Dirk
Van Horn. Inspired by his resolve of the previous
night, he had never played a better game
in all his days at prep school. He had fielded
like a veteran, and once he scooped in a pop fly
in such quick time that he had slammed it down
to Brick Ryan on first for a double play against
the unprepared Mr. Lane, who was caught trying
to regain first base. At the finish, when
Lefty told him that his position in left field
would be confirmed for the Shawnee game, he
glowed with the most pleasant feeling he had
enjoyed since he first put foot on the Lenape
campus.</p>
<p>He strolled back to Tent One with Lefty,
chatting eagerly of their prospects. When the
pair reached the tent, they found Sax McNulty
and the rest of their comrades gathered in an
excited group around Brick Ryan, who was
grinning broadly and trying modestly to conceal
his pride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, men?&rdquo; challenged Lefty.
&ldquo;Why all the celebration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just got the news that our gang will be
represented on the Long Trail this year!&rdquo; answered
the councilor. &ldquo;Congrats again, Brick!
He&rsquo;s going to help plant the Lenape pennant on
old Mount Kinnecut. Stand up, you red-headed
riot, and bow to the ladies and gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick blushed beneath his freckles. &ldquo;Aw, it&rsquo;s
not so much to talk about.&rdquo; He choked as his
friend Lefty Reardon pounded him on the back
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong there, old scout!&rdquo; Lefty
shouted. &ldquo;I went last year, and it was the
greatest thing that ever happened to me. Talk
about fun! And we had some exciting adventures,
too. Boy, when you&rsquo;re tenting by Lake
Moosehorn and catching a mess of bass for your
supper, think of poor Lefty back at Lenape,
wishing he was along again this season!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sax McNulty stared into the distance. &ldquo;I
scaled Kinnecut five&mdash;no, six&mdash;years ago, it
was,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never have such a
great time if I live to be a hundred and fifty!
Tiny Krouse, my canoe-mate, was chased two
miles by a mama-bear who thought he was trying
to kidnap her cubs! And the view from the
Lookout! Why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about it, Sax!&rdquo; begged Nig Jackson.</p>
<p>Dirk, who had been looking from one to another
of the eager boys, now broke in. &ldquo;Yes,
but first tell me what all this is about! What
is Brick going to do, anyway? Where is the
Long Trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him, Lefty,&rdquo; nodded McNulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Van, it&rsquo;s this way. The Long Trail
is an old Lenape custom that was started by six
fellows the first year the camp began. They
went for a sixty-mile trip from here to Mount
Kinnecut, up the river by canoes and over the
ponds to Lake Moosehorn, then hiking through
the big timber and climbing the mountain. Since
then, every year, six boys under a leader make
the same trip, and now there are nine Camp
Lenape pennants nailed to the tallest tree on the
very top of old Kinnecut, to show that the chosen
campers can come through a long endurance test
with flying colors. It&rsquo;s not an easy trail, and so
only the fellows who are best fitted for it can
go. Once you&rsquo;ve made the trip, you can&rsquo;t go
again&mdash;only Mr. Carrigan, who is in command,
has been over it before. I want to tell you
youngsters that it&rsquo;s the one big thing at Lenape
that you can never forget! Brick, I say it again,
you&rsquo;re a lucky bum!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>Dirk was still puzzled. &ldquo;How do they pick
the fellows to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they have to be in first-class shape all
around&mdash;healthy, full of pep and camp spirit,
and they have to know their way around on the
water and in the woods,&rdquo; said McNulty. &ldquo;And
Wise-Tongue Carrigan has made a good choice
this year, if you ask me. Besides Brick, he&rsquo;s
picked Steve Link, Wild Willie Sanders, Spaghetti
Megaro, Cowboy Platt, and Ugly Brown.
Ugly is younger than the rest, but he&rsquo;s a fine
little woodsman and can handle a canoe like an
Indian. I tell you, Van Horn, if you make the
most of your chances this summer, I wouldn&rsquo;t be
surprised to see you leading the list of Long
Trailers next season!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk stared at the friendly face of the leader,
and at Brick Ryan&rsquo;s happy grin. It must be the
most wonderful adventure in the world, the
Long Trail. But next season&mdash;that was a long
time to wait!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">OFF FOR CAMP SHAWNEE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; called the Chief, looking up
from the papers on his desk. &ldquo;Oh, hello,
Dirk! Sit down and tell me what&rsquo;s on your
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn carefully closed the door of
the little office, and faced the genial camp director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you aren&rsquo;t too busy, sir, I&rsquo;d like to ask
you something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never too busy to talk to campers! But it&rsquo;s
a fact that I haven&rsquo;t seen very much of you,
Dirk, since your folks brought you up here to
Lenape. Of course&rdquo;&mdash;the Chief smiled slightly&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard reports of your doings, now and
then. How do you like Lenape so far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy looked at the man ruefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
beginning to wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you shouldn&rsquo;t
ask how Lenape likes me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve learned a lot, if you know that,
Dirk.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have learned a lot. I&rsquo;ve only been here a
few days, Chief, but even I can see that I have
been an utter chump, all along. It&rsquo;s taken me
a long time to get things straight, and I&rsquo;m still
pretty green, I guess. But from now on, I want
to tell you I&rsquo;m trying to be a real camper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief leaned back in his chair, and rubbed
his chin reflectively. &ldquo;You seem to be in the
right frame of mind to do it, Dirk. We leaders
can help some, but unless a boy learns these
things from other boys and by thinking about
them himself, we can&rsquo;t do very much. But I
know,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that you didn&rsquo;t come here
this morning just to tell me you want to be a
true Lenape camper. What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk gulped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big thing to ask,&rdquo; he
blurted, &ldquo;and maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, out with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;Chief, I want to go on the
Long Trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some space of time after this pronouncement,
the man said nothing. Dirk, searching his
chief&rsquo;s face for some sign, breathed a heavy sigh
of disappointment, and rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Dirk! The Long Trail, eh? I
suppose you know what you&rsquo;re asking?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Dirk, with new eagerness in his eyes, sank
again into his chair. &ldquo;Mr. McNulty and some
of the chaps have been talking about it, and
Ryan, in our tent, is going. It must be a splendid
experience, sir, and I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash; Yes, I know
I&rsquo;m not much as a woodsman&mdash;why, I got lost
within a little way from the camp!&mdash;and I guess
I&rsquo;d be a drag on the rest of the fellows on a long
trip like that. But, oh, sir, give me a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief stared through the little window
over his desk, a tiny square through which came
a glimpse of the pines and the rippling waters of
Lake Lenape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys that Mr. Carrigan has chosen are
all picked campers,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Most of
them have spent three seasons here, and in that
time have learned the many things they must
know to take care of themselves on a long trip
that would test the endurance of many grown
men. Moreover, these boys realize that in order
to get through and plant our banner on Mount
Kinnecut, they must work together as one, must
share alike for the good of the tribe, as the old
Indians and scouts used to do. Out of the hundred
boys here each summer, only six are ever
chosen to take this trail for the honor of Lenape.
Now, knowing all this, do you still want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Dirk nodded dully. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m bigger and
stronger than Ugly Brown, and he&rsquo;s going!
And I&rsquo;d do my best to learn everything, and try
to keep up with the rest of the party&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brown is one of the best young campers we
have,&rdquo; observed the Chief, &ldquo;even if he is small.
If you knew a tenth as much as he does about
the woods and the water, you might stand a
chance. Come, now, Dirk, I know how you feel.
I&rsquo;ve known your dad for years, and I can guess
that if you ever wanted anything, he would get
it for you. But this thing you speak of is different.
You can only get it for yourself; and
the harder you work to earn it, the more you&rsquo;ll
value it. Learn as much as you can this summer,
and next year, we&rsquo;ll see about letting you hit the
trail for Kinnecut! How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk, not trusting himself to speak, shook
his head dumbly, and looked at the floor. He
might have known the Chief would say no, but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>The director was watching him with new interest.
&ldquo;Well, you are persistent!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;That might count for something in
your favor. Now, let me ask you a question.
You&rsquo;ve been at Lenape for four days. What
have you learned that will stand you in good
stead on a stiff hike and canoe-trip through
some of the wildest country in the state?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, I guess,&rdquo; confessed Dirk humbly.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even learned to swim, and even the
littlest fellows make fun of me wading around in
the shallow water. But I&rsquo;ll try, Chief, I will!
Only let me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your canoe is still on the dock, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Mr. Rawn said he wouldn&rsquo;t let me
take it out until I could swim and learn how to
handle a paddle. I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t bothered to learn.
I can see I&rsquo;ve wasted my time fooling around
with silly things, and loafing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. That&rsquo;s enough. Dirk, you have
lots of stuff in you that, if you want it badly
enough, can help you become a first-rate camper.
You&rsquo;ve shown it by getting out and chasing flies
on the baseball team, and that&rsquo;s a fine start. If
you really believe what you&rsquo;ve told me just now,
your spirit in the future will be the finest thing
that could come to you. You can see that your
chances of holding your own on the Long Trail
this year are pretty slim. But, since you&rsquo;re so
eager, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that there is a
chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Dirk&rsquo;s eyes widened, and he jumped up.
&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&mdash; What do you want me to do,
Chief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a bargain with you. Man to man.
The Long Trailers will start next Monday for
the river. That gives us five days. If, during
those five days, you can pass all the requirements
for the Lenape honor emblem, I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Carrigan
to take you along!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it? Why, Chief, that&rsquo;s
a wonderful offer! And I&rsquo;ll do it&mdash;I know I
will!&rdquo; Dirk cried.</p>
<p>The director was amused. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too
sure, Dirk. You don&rsquo;t know what you are up
against.&rdquo; He opened the drawer of his desk
and drew out a printed card. &ldquo;Here is a list of
the things you will have to do. It&rsquo;s a long list,
and four days is a short time. Remember, too,
that you must not neglect your regular camp
duties to work on any of the tests. One of the
requirements, and the biggest, is that you must
show a fine, all-around camp spirit; and that
means you will have to think of the honor of
your tent and the welfare of everybody and
everything in camp. But if you do a good job
out there in left field tomorrow at Shawnee, I&rsquo;ll
sign this card in this space calling for participation
in an inter-camp athletic contest, and that
will be one less test for you to do before Sunday
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Dirk took the card, and glanced at the rows
of print upon it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bargain!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll start working on the tests this very
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on! There&rsquo;s one thing more I want to
say before you rush out and start your job.
Remember what I&rsquo;ve told you&mdash;your chance of
fitting yourself for the Long Trail is a very slim
one indeed. Promise me that, in the event you
don&rsquo;t come through with your part of our bargain,
you will take it like a sportsman, and even
though you miss out this season, you will continue
in the same spirit that you are starting
now. It may be bitter medicine to take, but take
it like a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I promise, Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk fumbled for the doorknob, his heart full
of gratitude and a determination that was new
to him. He found himself outside the office,
standing on the porch with a cool wind about his
hot forehead. Through blurred eyes he scanned
the printed card in his hand, reading the list of
things that he must do within the coming days,
if he was to join Brick Ryan and the rest on
the Long Trail:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p class="center">REQUIREMENTS FOR LENAPE HONOR EMBLEM</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>1. Know the North Star and five constellations.</dt>
<dt>2. Collect fifteen wild flowers.</dt>
<dt>3. Identify fifteen trees.</dt>
<dt>4. Collect and identify five kinds of rocks.</dt>
<dt>5. Know ten birds.</dt>
<dt>6. Handle a rowboat and name ten parts of a boat.</dt>
<dt>7. Swim 100 yards.</dt>
<dt>8. Make a permanent woodcraft exhibit, or build some camp improvement.</dt>
<dt>9. Build a good cooking fire and cook potatoes, rice pudding, twist biscuit, and broiled meat.</dt>
<dt>10. Play on an athletic team in an inter-camp contest.</dt>
<dt>11. Take a part in a camp show.</dt>
<dt>12. Act as a tent aide for one day.</dt>
<dt>13. Show at all times the finest spirit as an all-round Lenape camper.</dt></dl>
<p>Dirk whistled as his eye ran down the list.
No wonder Brick and Lefty and the others wore
their green L badges with pride! And now, in
the few days remaining before the canoes cut the
water on the first leg of the journey to Kinnecut,
he must do all these things, or stay behind. But,
although he had never in all his life faced such
a task as this, he did not admit even to himself
that he might fail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>He buttoned the card carefully in his breast
pocket. Then, with a new light in his eyes, he
ran down the steep path toward the lake shore.
Mr. Wally Rawn, on duty at the dock before
morning swim period, was startled by the tall
figure of a boy who clutched his arm, and gasped
breathlessly: &ldquo;Wally, sir! Do you think you
could teach me to swim a hundred yards today?
I want to learn to swim, and I want to learn
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By nightfall, Dirk had not learned all that
there is to know about swimming, but Wally&rsquo;s
first lesson had given some confidence in handling
himself in the water, as well as a hope that
diligent practice should enable him to swim the
required number of yards at no distant date.
Moreover, the boy&rsquo;s lips tilted in a satisfied smile
as he glanced at the spaces on the requirement
card in his hand. Three items were already
initialed. Wally Rawn had found time to teach
him the rudiments of managing a rowboat.
Lefty Reardon, a bit doubtful of this sudden interest
in campcraft by the new boy but unaware
of its cause, had been persuaded to coach him
upon trees and rocks, and Van Horn&rsquo;s collection
and identification were vouched for by the initials
of Mr. Jim Avery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;Only ten more to go!&rdquo; Dirk breathed to himself.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get somebody to show me the stars
tonight, and in the morning&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He caught
his breath. &ldquo;Why, how could I forget? Tomorrow
is the day of the big game with Shawnee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Sax McNulty looked over at
him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s come over you, young lad?&rdquo; the
leader asked. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you loved to
chase flies so much that you&rsquo;re bubbling with
boyish glee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love to chase flies, Sax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not that much. There&rsquo;s something else.
I never saw anybody in such a burning hurry to
have an honor emblem pinned on his shirt. I&rsquo;m
suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you now, Sax. But will you help
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>McNulty snorted. &ldquo;Do you have to ask?
Now, hop into your bathrobes, you birds&mdash;What
will become of Camp Shawnee if you sleep all
day?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;Shawnee&rdquo; was the word that rose oftenest in
the babel at the breakfast table. All the boys
were in hiking clothes, ready for the ten-mile
trail that fringed the mountains running north.
Within a few minutes after the meal was over,
Dirk had seen disappear into the woods all his
tent-mates with the exception of Lefty and
Brick, who, with the rest of the Lenape nine,
were to ride to Shawnee and thus keep fresh for
the big contest of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Dirk fingered his glove nervously, and wondered
what sort of ball field the Shawnee campus
would provide. Somebody slapped him on the
back. It was Spaghetti Megaro, second baseman,
and a gay light shone in the Italian boy&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re worried, huh? Well, forget it! If
we don&rsquo;t win, we lose. But I think we win!
Come, the truck is loaded&mdash;pile on and hang
tight. If you can ride this flivver, the bucking
broncho is nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Spaghett.&rdquo; Dirk joined the crowding
band that jostled each other laughingly as
they sought places in the body of the camp
truck. Stirring up a cyclone of dust, the car left
Lenape deserted, and rattled off up the rutted
lane. Dirk Van Horn, clinging to the dashboard
with both hands, stared into the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we win!&rdquo; he repeated softly. &ldquo;And
I&mdash;I must do a good job, the Chief said. Well,
in just a few hours I&rsquo;ll have my chance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE CAPTAIN</span></h2>
<p>It was the end of the fourth inning, and Camp
Shawnee had players on second and third
with two out. The eager boys were on their toes,
taking long leads and praying that Widelle, at
bat, would bring them in with one of his famous
sky-high clouts.</p>
<p>Lefty wound up and delivered a whistling
curve that landed in Gil Shelton&rsquo;s mitt with a
satisfying smack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike two!&rdquo; called Judge Kinney of Elmville,
umpire for the day. The boys of Camp
Lenape, grouped along the sidelines of the
Shawnee diamond, raised a cheer of praise for
their pitcher&rsquo;s prowess.</p>
<p>Widelle, who wore on his jersey the red arrow-head
insignia of Lenape&rsquo;s rival camp, shifted his
bat slightly and set himself, ready for what
might prove the final toss of the inning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;You got him measured for a homer!&rdquo; Captain
Hook Bollard was encouraging his team-mate
with loud yells. &ldquo;Take it on the nose!&rdquo;
He, as well as the two hundred other spectators,
invader and defender alike, held his breath as
Lefty uncorked a fast one. More than one person
in the stands didn&rsquo;t see that ball coming.
But Widelle saw it; moreover, he connected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zowie!&rdquo; shrieked Bollard. &ldquo;Go it, Widdy!
A love-ly skyscraper!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a perfect hit; a bit too lofty for security,
but nevertheless pretty. Two hundred
pairs of eyes watched the horsehide sphere climb
over left field, then drop with increasing speed
toward the earth. Widelle was nearing first, and
already had his eye on second. The man on third
was trotting confidently toward the home plate.
But no one saw them. Lenape and Shawnee
eyes were fastened on that descending ball; and
now they were aware of a lithe figure in a
tailored baseball suit, streaking backwards with
head tilted to avoid the afternoon sun. Back,
back the figure raced; a sudden daring leap, a
slap as leather hit leather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;He dropped it!&rdquo; howled Bollard. The
Lenape ranks groaned as the fielder fell sprawling;
but the groan changed to unbelieving cries
as they saw that one arm was still raised aloft,
and a hand still clutched the fatal sphere! The
fielder was on his feet again, slamming a long,
easy toss to Brick Ryan at first. Brick touched
the bag, and the Lenape team trooped in to take
their turn at bat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Van Horn! Boy, what a catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yay, Van! Pretty stuff, old kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk trotted toward the bench, and the cheers
of his fellow campers grew. He tried to put on
a modest, matter-of-fact look, but he could not
hold back a confident grin. The Chief was there;
he must have seen that catch, and the least he
could do would be to sign his card for inter-camp
athletics. Now, he would come to bat this inning,
and then he&rsquo;d show these kids some real
prep-school league hitting&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He felt his arm seized roughly, and a voice,
low yet angry, rasped in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Van Horn, there&rsquo;s eight other guys on
this team!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk wheeled. It was Lefty Reardon who
spoke, and his face was ominous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean by that?&rdquo; Dirk
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean! With the score
three to one against us, why do you have to go
playing tiddley-winks to the grandstand? Another
pass like that, and you&rsquo;ll be holding down
the job of water-boy for this team!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter with that play?&rdquo;
grumbled Van Horn sulkily. &ldquo;They went out,
didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the matter? Everything! These
kids here in the cheering section thought you
were a regular daredevil, but I know better!
Try that stunt again and you&rsquo;ll get a rain-check
instead of a bouquet. Talk about playing to the
gallery! That was an easy catch&mdash;but you had
to make it look like hero stuff. And taking all
those chances, falling down and so on, just to
look like the bozo that saved the day! Well,
Terry Tompkins ain&rsquo;t got a swelled head, and
if you don&rsquo;t button up quick, you&rsquo;ll be benching
for the rest of the season. And I&rsquo;m saying it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away, leaving Dirk with a flaming
face. Suppose he had made that catch seem a
bit harder&mdash;what was the harm? He really had
stumbled, but there had been no danger of
dropping the ball. What right had Reardon to
call him a swell-head, just because&mdash;&mdash;? But
secretly, Dirk knew that Lefty had spoken
justly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>With burning cheeks, he watched Soapy Mullins
fan out. Brick Ryan, after tipping two
fouls, was allowed to walk. Ken Haviland
stalled, taking two strikes while Brick stole
second, and outguessed on a fast inshoot,
dropped his bat as the umpire called him out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, you fielder!&rdquo; Lefty was calling.
Dirk realized that he was next.</p>
<p>A little chill chased itself up his spine as he
grabbed his own bat and hurried to the plate.
But as he stepped up and faced Bollard&rsquo;s wind-up,
all his nervousness left him. He&rsquo;d show
these kids&mdash;and Lefty Reardon in particular&mdash;that
he could save their old ball-game yet. He
knew he was good. He knew he was going to
hit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hadn&rsquo;t moved. Bollard was worried, and
he kept a wary eye on Brick, who was fully
prepared to steal to third at an instant&rsquo;s notice.
The Lenape boys set up a roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll walk you, Van! Let him do it!&rdquo;
advised Captain Reardon.</p>
<p>Dirk&rsquo;s face did not show that he had heard.
He was out after a hit. He let the next one go
by, and waited for a good one. It came.</p>
<p>Sock! He had placed it just right, a red-hot
cannonball that went through shortstop like a
rocket. Dirk&rsquo;s cleats spurned the dusty track
that led to first base.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>Behind him rose the shrieks of Lenape and
Shawnee. Among them he thought he heard the
voice of Lefty Reardon, but he gave it not a
thought. That swat was good for a two-bagger
or nothing. He tapped first with his toe, and
streaked for second. The shouts grew louder,
but there was nobody in his path. Evidently the
fielder was still tangled up in his own feet.
Maybe a three-bagger&mdash;&mdash;? Dirk leaped on
second base, shook the sweat out of his eyes, and
looked ahead.</p>
<p>There was a knot of players at third, and one
of them must have the ball. Another was on the
ground&mdash;&mdash; Why, it was Brick Ryan! Dirk
had forgotten all about Brick; but there he was,
with one arm stretched out, just touching the
bag. Another boy, a Shawnee baseman, was
crouched at his side, while above them stood a
man who, as Dirk watched, shouted &ldquo;Safe!&rdquo;
It was the field umpire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Remorse showered on Dirk like a torrent.
Brick had made it, but only because he was a top-notch
player; while he, Dirk, had been to blame
for the worst fool stunt in his baseball career.
He could feel Lefty Reardon&rsquo;s despairing eye
on him, and could imagine what the captain was
thinking. &ldquo;Grandstand stuff again!&rdquo; Van
Horn, thinking only of himself and his own
glory, had made a two-bagger, but had forced
Ryan into a tight fix at third; it was only a
matter of an instant&rsquo;s decision that had saved
the Lenape team from missing their big chance
to score.</p>
<p>For half a minute, Dirk was rattled. The
knot at third base broke up; the boys resumed
their places, and Brick, grinning, rose and dusted
his trousers while keeping an eye on Bollard,
who strolled back into the box. The Shawnee
team was now on the defensive; the pitcher had
two men to watch, and Megaro was up&mdash;Megaro,
the heaviest slugger on the Lenape side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t quit!&rdquo; Dirk swore under his breath.
&ldquo;It was a fool trick&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got to play it
through!&rdquo; He took his eyes from Reardon, at
the bench, and watched the pitcher. Bollard put
across two wild throws, and Megaro tipped a
foul. Dirk took a wary lead, and Brick Ryan
did the same.</p>
<p>A roar from two hundred throats sounded
from the watching crowd. Crack! When the
dust lifted, Megaro was safe at first; Brick Ryan
was clear of home plate and Dirk Van Horn
stretched over that same plate with the umpire&rsquo;s
cry in his ears: &ldquo;Safe by a mile!&rdquo; He had slid
for the tying run almost on Ryan&rsquo;s heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>But there was no joy for Dirk in the rousing
applause of the watchers. From the tail of his
eye, he saw Lefty approaching, and knew what
was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Captain,&rdquo; he said humbly; &ldquo;you
can take me out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan put in a word. &ldquo;Let him alone,
Lefty! You know those things happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Brick,&rdquo; snapped Reardon. &ldquo;It
was only luck you got out of it, and I already
warned him. He&rsquo;s done. Tompkins will play
left field for the rest of this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t you see he cleared himself? We
made two runs, and that ought to make you
happier, Lefty. Gollies sakes, it&rsquo;s all in a ball
game&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, Ryan, old chap&mdash;you&rsquo;re white about
it, but Lefty&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; admitted Dirk. &ldquo;I forced
you, just to show off. Maybe some day,&rdquo; he
ended miserably, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn how to play on a
team.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Many a curious glance followed him as he
pushed through the admiring bunch of Lenape
boys who clustered on the sidelines; but Ollie
Steffins was at bat, and the invading campers,
thirsting for more rapid-action runs, did not
notice him as he headed behind the tent-houses
that ringed the Shawnee diamond. He passed
the lodge overlooking the brown waters of Iron
Lake, and started down the road by which the
hikers had marched that morning into the rival
encampment. There were still two innings to
play, but Dirk Van Horn did not want to see
the end of that game. Camp Lenape was ten
miles away, and he must hike. He went on his
way; and as he went, he thought....</p>
<p>That night there was jubilation in Camp
Lenape. Hated Shawnee had been taught a
lesson on the diamond, by the slender margin of
one run made in the last inning by Blackie
Thorne. There were comments at the supper
table, however, upon the sportsmanship and hospitality
of the defeated camp, who had taken
their defeat in good nature, and in parting had
promised vengeance at the next inter-camp tilt.
Tired hikers ate like wolves, assuring each other
between mouthfuls that it had been a swell day.</p>
<p>Dishes had to be washed. At Tent One table,
Lefty and Eddie Scolter were due for this detail.
The latter, however, could hardly keep his eyes
open&mdash;the long hike, the swim in Iron Lake, and
the excitements of the day&rsquo;s visit at Shawnee had
been almost too much for the small lad. He
nodded gratefully when Dirk Van Horn offered
to take his place. Sax McNulty raised his eyebrows
at this generosity, but made no remark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Lefty busied himself with a broom and piled
the dishes while Dirk mixed up suds in the pan.
It was Lefty who spoke first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a bit heated up this afternoon,&rdquo; he confessed
casually. &ldquo;Hope you didn&rsquo;t take me too
seriously, Van. Sometimes, when a guy is
captain of a team, he has to say things and do
things he doesn&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;re sore about it,&rdquo; the aide
went on. &ldquo;Brick Ryan was taking your part,
on the way home, and darned if he didn&rsquo;t convince
me that I was wrong in bawling you out
the way I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sore,&rdquo; admitted Dirk; &ldquo;but at myself,
not at you. You were quite right to kick me
out. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s not easy to say it, but I&rsquo;m pretty
much of a swell-head any way you put it. Will
you do me a favor, Reardon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, next time you see me getting ready
to do any more stunts like that, will you oblige
me by a swift kick in the seat of my pants?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>Lefty laughed. &ldquo;I will! Now, I want to ask
you something. You want to go on the Long
Trail, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blond boy stared and almost dropped a
dish on the floor. &ldquo;How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can see! But the Long Trail is a
pretty stiff proposition. What makes you think
you can tackle it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a crazy hope. But the Chief said
there was a slim chance, and I want to go more
than I ever wanted to do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth working for, I&rsquo;ll
say! So now you&rsquo;ve given up bunk-stretching
and are going full speed ahead on your emblem
and winning ball-games and thinking of the
other fellow first&mdash;&mdash; Well, I&rsquo;m here to say
I&rsquo;ll help you all I can, and any other older
camper will do the same! Now, what things do
you still have to do to get your emblem?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE MYSTERIOUS WATCHER</span></h2>
<p>Dirk pushed back his unruly hair, pulled
a sheet of paper from the roller of his
portable typewriter, and read what he had just
written.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;Camp Lenape, Thursday.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Dad</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am writing this to you especially because
I want to thank you for sending me up
here to Camp Lenape. I must admit that at
first I didn&rsquo;t seem to get over so well with the
fellows, but that was all my own fault, and now
that everything is going fine, I can see why you
wanted me to spend my summer with such a
swell bunch of campers and leaders. My, the
Chief must have been a great man to be friends
with when you were in college together! He has
certainly been nice to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take a whole book to tell you all
the things that have happened to me since you
and Mama left. We played baseball with a
camp named Shawnee, and beat them. I was
fielding for a while, but got kicked out of the
game in the middle because of a fool stunt, so I
didn&rsquo;t help the team any. You met the captain&mdash;Lefty
Reardon, a splendid pitcher that I wish
we had on our prep-school squad. He&rsquo;s just one
of the chaps in my tent&mdash;all of them are awfully
lively and full of fun. I had a fight with a kid
named Brick Ryan, but now we&rsquo;re good friends.
He&rsquo;s a red-headed kid in our tent. Mr. McNulty,
our leader, looks gloomy all the time but that is
just his way, and the things he says would make
you die laughing. He plays the sax, so they all
call him Sax. He&rsquo;s our councilor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you would be surprised if you knew
all the things I learned about stars and flowers
and boats and things. One of the kids tried to
fool me and say that one tree was a castor oil
tree that the castor oil came from, but I guess
I&rsquo;m not so green as to believe that, though. I&rsquo;m
learning to swim some, and Brick Ryan is showing
me about diving into the water head first.
He&rsquo;s got what they call a Lenape honor emblem,
which you can get for your jersey if you know
a lot of camp things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to work hard here to keep the tent
clean and get merit points to win a pennant
every day to show which is the best tent. The
first day I didn&rsquo;t clean up enough and we got
the &lsquo;booby can&rsquo; that we had to hang up with
&lsquo;booby&rsquo; written on it. Each of us has to be
waiter and wash dishes, but that&rsquo;s fun too, like
seeing if you can get &lsquo;seconds&rsquo; on meat and
potatoes when you&rsquo;re the waiter. Tell Mama
not to bother sending up all that candy and cake
and stuff I asked for, because Wally Rawn, the
swimming coach, says it&rsquo;s bad to eat a lot of junk
between meals all the time. I have to be in
training now, because I want to learn to swim
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the big news. The Chief told me
that if I got my honor emblem all done and know
everything by Sunday night, he will ask Mr.
Carrigan to take me on the Long Trail. The
Long Trail is a swell trip up the river and a hike
through the woods and up a mountain, and I
want to go if I can, so if the Chief will let me,
say you won&rsquo;t mind! I guess it&rsquo;s quite exciting,
because everybody wants to go, but only six can
go every year, and if I go that will be seven.
One of the fellows that is going is Brick Ryan.
Reardon went last year, and he says you can
catch bass fish and you take along a flag and
nail it to a tree on top of the mountain. &lsquo;Sax&rsquo;
went once and a bear chased his canoe-mate, but
don&rsquo;t tell Mama that part or she will worry.
But Mr. Carrigan is quite a woodsman and
knows all about nature and things, although to
look at him you wouldn&rsquo;t think so, because he
looks sort of funny and has a big nose. He
knows all about bears. I can take along the
canoe you gave me, the <i>Sachem</i>. The other fellows
are Steve Link and a fellow we call &lsquo;Spaghetti&rsquo;
because his name is Megaro and he&rsquo;s
Italian, and Wild Willie Sanders and Ugly
Brown and a fellow named Cowboy Platt who
comes from Arizona where the cowboys come
from. Ugly Brown is smaller than I am, but
he knows a lot about the woods. Before we go
we have to pass a physical examination but I
never felt better in my life because I&rsquo;m in training.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today I am being the tent aide. That is a
rather important job, as you see it means you
have to be a sort of assistant to the leader and
keep all the fellows on their toes doing the right
things, and yet do it without being bossy or
mean. Lefty is the regular aide, but he let me
do it to try for one part of my honor emblem.
I still have lots of tests to pass for it yet.
&lsquo;Gollies,&rsquo; as my friend Brick Ryan would say,
I sure hope that I don&rsquo;t miss out and can&rsquo;t finish
it all by Sunday, for then I wouldn&rsquo;t dare ask
the Chief to let me go on the Long Trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must get busy now and do some
more things, but don&rsquo;t forget that I&rsquo;m to go to
Mt. Kinnecut with the long trailers, and that if
the Chief gives his permission, you will too. You
can explain things to Mama, but don&rsquo;t mention
the bears.</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;Your affectionate son,</span>
<span class="jr">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dirk van Horn</span>.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>The writer surveyed this composition thoughtfully,
scratched his ear, and replacing the page
in the machine, added a brief paragraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;P.S. Tell Mama not to worry about getting
my feet wet. I haven&rsquo;t taken any of those
pills for several days, but I thought it over and
I think that anybody that feels as good as I do
doesn&rsquo;t need any pills. I&rsquo;m getting nice and tan
like a sailor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>Slipping his letter into an envelope addressed
to &ldquo;Mr. John T. Van Horn, President, Commerce
National Bank,&rdquo; Dirk stuck on a stamp
and his missive was ready for the mail. He had
just stepped outside the tent when he caught
sight of Brick Ryan, lugging a sack on his
shoulders and making his way down the hillside
at a fast pace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Brick!&rdquo; Dirk hailed him. &ldquo;Say, wait
for a chap! Is that the mail-bag you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick halted and nodded. &ldquo;Long Jim gave
me the chance to take it down to Heaven for him
today. He&rsquo;s busy at the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s a letter I want to go in, special.&rdquo;
He caught up to his red-headed tent-mate and
slipped his letter into the top of the canvas sack.
Brick grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody must be writing to their mamas
and sweethearts today, all right. Gollies, what
a hefty load! Say, Van, do you want to go
along and help row the boat? Give you some
practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I?&rdquo; Dirk became reflective. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
supposed to be acting as aide today, but maybe
I can go. I sure would like to help. I tell you&mdash;you
go on down, and if I can get away, I&rsquo;ll be
down to the dock in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>They parted, and Dirk raced to the lodge,
where he found his councilor practicing with the
camp orchestra in preparation for a vaudeville
show that was on the program for the following
night. Securing his ready permission to assist
the mail-carrier of the day, Dirk cut through the
trees below the tents and reached the dock almost
as soon as the burdened Brick arrived.</p>
<p>Selecting a steel-bottomed rowboat from
among those moored in the lee of the diving
tower, the two boys pushed off on the waters of
Lake Lenape. Dirk, amidships, took the unwieldy
oars and with unskilled motions began
sculling in the direction of the north end of the
lake, where a landing jutted from the weedy
shore, beyond which faintly showed the roof of
Heaven House, the little cottage that was used
for the accommodation of parents and guests
who visited the mountain camp.</p>
<p>They had gone only a few hundred yards when
Brick, lounging easily on the stern-sheets with
the mail sack between his knees, made an offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, my lad, how would you like to see some
baby kingfishers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; answered Van Horn. &ldquo;Where are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, cut over a few points toward the
shore, and we&rsquo;ll just stop in up the creek a ways.
They have their nest in a hollow stump. We&rsquo;ve
got plenty of time to take a look, if we hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Dirk pulled on his oars with renewed vigor,
and the boat headed toward the reed-masked
inlet of the marshy creek that cut into the camp
side of the lake. He was already getting the
knack of handling the little craft with greater
ease, so that they slipped softly under an overhanging
maple branch and entered the weed-bordered
reach of water without a splash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; whispered Brick. &ldquo;Keep
quiet, or you&rsquo;ll scare &rsquo;em. Say! Who&rsquo;s that
guy?&rdquo; He pointed.</p>
<p>Dirk clumsily shipped his oars, and at the
sound a man on a little hillock above them
wheeled sharply and stared, at the same time
whipping one hand behind his back. The keel of
the boat grated on the shore, barely missing
a slender bamboo fishing rod that lay there
neglected.</p>
<p>The man ran toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir!&rdquo; cried Dirk cheerily. &ldquo;We seem
to have spoiled your fishing for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger did not return his smile. He
stared for a second, then queerly enough, exclaimed:
&ldquo;Why, if it ain&rsquo;t young Van Horn!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>For a space there was silence, except for the
resounding thuds of axes on wood and the far
shouts of boys toward the head of the creek
where, Dirk recalled, a woodcraft squad was
building a bridge of birch-trunks. He surveyed
the unknown fisherman. The man was short
and slender; and his dress was poorly adapted to
the waterside, for he wore a suit of creased and
dusty serge, and thin-soled, pointed low shoes.
A cloth cap was pulled down over his pale face,
almost hiding a pair of the steeliest blue eyes
Dirk had ever seen, that stared at him coldly all
the while as the man stood, hands behind back,
biting his lip as if he would have cut short his
surprising cry of recognition.</p>
<p>Brick Ryan had all this time spoken no word.
Finally Dirk broke the uncomfortable silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know my name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated. &ldquo;Why&mdash;I guess everybody
knows by sight a famous kid like you. I
thought I was right. Your old man&rsquo;s the banker,
ain&rsquo;t he? Say,&rdquo; he went on more easily, &ldquo;how
would you and your smart-lookin&rsquo; partner there
like to take a little joy-ride around the country
with me for half an hour or so? I got a little
car over by the road, and you can drive a ways
if you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such an offer a few days previously might
well have tempted Dirk&rsquo;s adventurous instincts;
but he remembered that he and Brick were
charged with a mission to perform.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice of you, especially since we upset
your fishing here,&rdquo; he returned; &ldquo;but Brick and
I have to take care of the mail. Besides, we
don&rsquo;t leave the camp without permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, let&rsquo;s beat it,&rdquo; put in Brick, shoving
the oars into the rowlocks.</p>
<p>Dirk nodded, and began backing water. The
man made a quick step toward them, and his
right arm jerked impulsively; but he made no
effort to detain them. He stood gazing at them
with his cold blue eyes until they vanished again
beyond the leafy screen that hid the entrance to
the creek.</p>
<p>Once more heading across the lake toward
Heaven House, all thoughts of kingfishers&rsquo; nests
forgotten, Brick spoke reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something funny about that bird,&rdquo;
he began. &ldquo;Ever seen him before, Van?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, not that I remember. Funny he knew
my name. I guess we spoiled his fishing&mdash;too
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick snorted. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got eyes? He&rsquo;s
no fisherman&mdash;not in that outfit. His rod didn&rsquo;t
even have bait on the line, and besides, any sap
would know that there&rsquo;s no fish in that part of
the creek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what was he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;He was spyin&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; the red-haired
boy exploded. &ldquo;Spyin&rsquo; on the camp, or I&rsquo;m a
monkey&rsquo;s uncle! I guess you didn&rsquo;t notice when
we first saw him, but he was standin&rsquo; there on
the hill, lookin&rsquo; through the trees with a pair of
field glasses, straight at the lodge! He&rsquo;s after
no good, if you ask me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Brick, are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;m sure! What I want to know is,
what&rsquo;s his game? &lsquo;Let me take you for a joy-ride,&rsquo;
he says. Huh!&rdquo; Brick spat into the
rippling wake of the boat.</p>
<p>Dirk pulled thoughtfully at the oars. They
were now nearing the wharf that was their goal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s puzzling, all right. But I still think
you&rsquo;re too suspicious, Brick.&rdquo; Nevertheless, he
was not altogether sure that Ryan&rsquo;s distrust was
wholly without grounds, and he could not rid
himself of the feeling that he had somewhere
before seen that pale grim face and frosty eyes.</p>
<p>The two boys tied their craft at the end of the
jutting wharf, hauled the mail-sack ashore, and
between them carried it up the path to Heaven
House. The little cottage was empty at that
time, but the flower garden in front was carefully
weeded and tended. As they reached the
gate, a cloud of dust bearing up the Elmville
road told them that they had delivered their
burden with little time to spare.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>The rattling flivver that served the rural route
drew up before them with a screeching of brakes,
and Lem Shuttle, the driver, took off his straw
hat and wiped his bald head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there the camp mail, boys?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Hot today, bean&rsquo;t it? Got a mighty heap of
letters for ye to take back, and a couple parcels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick heaved the sack into the rear seat of the
rattletrap car. &ldquo;Say, Lem,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we just
saw a strange guy fishin&rsquo; down by the creek.
Know who he is? Wearin&rsquo; a blue suit, and
doesn&rsquo;t know much about how to catch fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lem scratched one ear. &ldquo;Heard tell of him
as I come along. Peaked kind of little feller,
eh? Yep, he drove up to the Petties last night
in a blue sedan, and they took him in to board.
Give his name as Brown or McGillicuddy or
Harkins or some such. Claimed he wanted to do
a bit of fishin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he was tryin&rsquo; to catch &rsquo;em without any
bait on his hook. Down by the creek, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>The mail-carrier chuckled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t surprise
me a mite, now! Them city folk is all of &rsquo;em
crazy as coots! Most of &rsquo;em don&rsquo;t know oxen
from buttercups! Wal, got to be goin&rsquo;.&rdquo; He
tossed out the sack of incoming mail, released
the brakes, and stepped on the gas. &ldquo;Giddap,
Napoleon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys watched him as he careened off down
the dusty road. Brick Ryan nodded reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;mm! He wants to catch some fish, so he
takes along a pair of field glasses to see &rsquo;em with!
Stayin&rsquo; up at the Pettie house. Well, Van, old
oyster, I&rsquo;ll bet you this won&rsquo;t be the last time
we see Mr. Nosey Fisherman, or my name&rsquo;s not
F. X. A. Ryan!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">ON THE MARCH</span></h2>
<p>The mysterious fisherman, none the less, was
pushed out of Dirk&rsquo;s mind by the crowded
hours of the camp routine. There were still half
a dozen blank spaces on the emblem card that
pointed his way to the Long Trail; and as the
end of the week drew near, he was in a fever of
excitement, wondering if ever he would complete
all the needful tests in time.</p>
<p>His day of service as aide to Tent One was
finished without mishap; and late the same afternoon
he managed, after scorching a pan of rice
and burning his fingers, to produce an edible
meal cooked over an open fire built by himself.
On Friday morning he rose before Reveille and
in company with Long Jim Avery and Nig
Jackson penetrated silently into the dewy woods,
noting the plumage and song of many birds that
Long Jim pointed out to the interested boys.
At the performance that evening of the Lenape
Vode-Villians on the improvised stage in the
lodge, he won applause with a short act entitled
&ldquo;A Wee Drop of Scotch.&rdquo; In golf sox, a kilt
made of a plaid blanket, and a tam-o&rsquo;-shanter,
he sang several songs of Scotland and cracked
all the jokes he knew about the canny race,
marking his points with a crooked and knobbed
cane cut from one of Farmer Podgett&rsquo;s apple
trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>One by one the blank spaces on the card were
filled in by the initials of some councilor. On
Saturday afternoon Dirk, after helping Jim
Avery after lunch at the store, raced to the boat
dock and took his final swimming test, diving
into the water head-first as Brick Ryan had
taught him, and rounding a life-boat stationed
fifty yards out, in all handling himself so neatly
that he won a nod from Wally Rawn and a
promise to be allowed to help keep the score in
the inter-tent Boat Regatta that afternoon.</p>
<p>Dirk arose at dawn on Sunday morning, when
around him all the camp was asleep. He shivered
as he looked into the misty drizzle that fell
among the pines; but screwing up his resolution,
threw off the warm blankets and slipped into his
heavier clothing and high laced boots. His woodcraft
exhibit, a rustic birchwood bench circling
the wild-cherry tree beyond the lodge, was still
uncompleted; and his skill at axmanship was far
from great. He sighed as he shouldered his hand
ax and went through the dripping woods to a
grove of birches beyond the Council Ring; but
the work warmed him in short order, and he was
soon whistling as he trimmed the smooth white
saplings and split them for his purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>It still lacked half an hour to Reveille&mdash;which
always came later on Sundays&mdash;when Dirk
stepped back from his work at the base of the
cherry tree, and surveyed his progress. The
little bench needed only a few more slats in the
seat to be completed and ready for the use of all
campers; the braces were as steady as Dirk
could make them, each sunk some inches into the
ground and set with wedged rocks. The boy
stood sucking his thumb, which had received a
blow of his ax-head instead of the nail at which
he had aimed; and thus he was unaware that the
Chief had approached in his silent fashion and
was at his elbow.</p>
<p>The Chief&rsquo;s face was as unreadable as ever as
he nodded in answer to Dirk&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;
merely striding to the bench and testing it
with his weight. Sitting there, he gazed at the
eager lad and smiled gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good bench,&rdquo; he said, and paused. Then:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dirk, you&rsquo;ve been working mighty hard on
your emblem, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only have two more things to finish, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;mm. Dirk, what would you say if I told
you that, even if you finished these two things,
you couldn&rsquo;t go on the Long Trail this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s face went white, and he gulped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d say you know best about that sir,&rdquo;
but his lip trembled with disappointment.</p>
<p>The Chief, who had been watching him closely,
laughed&mdash;rather cruelly, as Dirk thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see your emblem card.&rdquo; He took it
from Dirk&rsquo;s hand, and pointed to the thirteenth
item. &ldquo;It says here that any boy winning the
Lenape honor emblem must show at all times
the finest spirit as an all-round camper. Well,
any boy who can answer me as you have just
done&mdash;&mdash;Look there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed behind the lodge, where a large
hay-wagon pulled by two horses came into sight,
sweeping toward the road leading up the mountain.
Upon it were securely lashed three canoes&mdash;and
on top, gleaming red, was the <i>Sachem</i>.
The <i>Sachem</i>!</p>
<p>The Chief was scrawling his initials on the
two empty spaces of the card. Dirk let out a
whoop like an Iroquois on the warpath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, Chief!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You mean
it! I&rsquo;m going on the Long Trail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks that way. Last night I got an
answer from my telegram to your father. He&rsquo;s
given his permission for you to join Sagamore
Carrigan&rsquo;s trailers. You still have much to
learn, Dirk, but with this new spirit of yours, I
think you&rsquo;ll win out!&rdquo; He clasped hands with
the dancing boy.</p>
<p>At breakfast, Mr. Carrigan ordered that all
Long Trailers report to him immediately to have
their outfits inspected, and to receive instructions.
Within fifteen minutes Dirk and Brick
Ryan had carried several armloads of belongings
up to the lodge porch and stacked them alongside
of the kits of their five comrades who had
been chosen to bear the Lenape flag. Cowboy
Platt, lounging at the rail, opened his eyes wide
as he took in the heap of things that Dirk had
thought necessary to bring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shore must be goin&rsquo; to take a pack-hoss
along to tote all that,&rdquo; he remarked in his sleepy
drawl. &ldquo;Wait till old Wise-Tongue sees that
pile, pardner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, when Mr. Carrigan arrived a
few minutes later, his first words were on the
necessity of &ldquo;travelling light.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going Indian fashion,&rdquo; he began,
&ldquo;and since each one of you will have to carry
all your outfit on your back, we must take only
the things that we cannot do without. Now,
Dirk, suppose that when we come to the first
portage, you have to pack all those clothes and
shoes and that big flash-lantern, as well as your
blankets and your end of the canoe! Let&rsquo;s see
what you can do without.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The councilor began laying aside only those
belongings that would be needed on the trip.
When he had finished, Dirk found his kit reduced
to a sturdy hiking outfit of khaki shirt and
breeches, puttees, and high shoes, a change of
underclothing, a warm sweater, and four pairs
of socks. In addition, he had for canoe-work a
pair of shorts and light shoepacks. Since two
boys would sleep together, one large warm
blanket and rubber poncho apiece was adjudged
sufficient, even though the mountain nights would
be cool.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you have a pocket compass
and a good knife,&rdquo; concluded Sagamore Carrigan.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take my large woodsman&rsquo;s ax, and
Sanders will take his hand ax&mdash;that should be
enough for the whole party. Cowboy Platt here
has offered to do all the cooking, if we take
turns at K.P. I&rsquo;ve drawn from the kitchen only
the grub that we can&rsquo;t get along the way, and
we&rsquo;ll save it for &lsquo;iron rations&rsquo; in the back-country.
Ellick also gave me some pots and
pans, but each trailer will have to take his own
cup and plate and fork. Before we leave tomorrow,
I&rsquo;ll have another inspection and try to
see that we don&rsquo;t forget anything we need.
Have your blanket-rolls ready immediately after
breakfast. Any questions about outfits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spaghetti Megaro and young Brown had need
of the councilor&rsquo;s advice about selecting certain
of their garments. After he had given it, he
unrolled a large map and tacked it to the pine
shingles of the lodge wall, where all could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you trailers to get every line of this
map into your minds,&rdquo; he urged. &ldquo;Learn it so
you could draw it blindfolded. It will be riding
in my pocket for the whole trip, and whenever
any of you has a minute to spare, study it.
You can see that I&rsquo;ve lined in the Long Trail
in red ink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk breathed faster as his eyes followed
Sagamore Wise-Tongue&rsquo;s pointing finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Lenape, and way off here in the
corner is old Mount Kinnecut, where nine green-and-white
pennants are flying. That&rsquo;s where
we&rsquo;ve got to go, and we&rsquo;ll make it in three days,
if all goes well. The first day&rsquo;s run&mdash;tomorrow&mdash;will
be an easy stage, just to get in trim and
harden up. And see that your feet are in good
shape, for that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll have to travel on
most of the way. We&rsquo;ll stop at Pot-Hole Glen
at noon, and make the river before dark. The
canoes left on a wagon this morning, and we&rsquo;ll
find them at Skinner&rsquo;s Ferry when we get there.
Now, I&rsquo;ll leave this map posted here for the rest
of the day, so that you can get its details clear
in mind before we leave. Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I got one!&rdquo; put in Ugly Brown.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s going to carry the flag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sagamore Wise-Tongue smiled, and drew
from his blouse a triangular bit of green bunting
on which was stitched a large L in white. &ldquo;The
trailer who carries this,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will have to
be watchful and cunning, for he will bear with
him the honor of all of us, and the honor of
Lenape. I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to choose which
trailer it shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before anyone else could speak, Dirk cried
out: &ldquo;Brick Ryan! He&rsquo;s the best of us! Let it
be Brick, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Megaro, &ldquo;I bet you my life
Brick is the one. I vote for him too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>The others added their votes with shouts of
approval; even Ugly Brown, who secretly had
hoped to be the standard-bearer, swallowed his
disappointment, and taking the banner, presented
it to Ryan, whose face grew almost as red
as his flaming hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it,&rdquo; he muttered with some feeling;
then, looking the leader straight in the eye,
added: &ldquo;You can bet nobody is goin&rsquo; to get this
away from me, Wise-Tongue. It&rsquo;s not goin&rsquo; to
leave me until we nail it to the flagpole on the
big mountain over beyond!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a cheer, the little council of war broke
up. Brick stowed the pennant inside his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, kid,&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;That was
swell of you to say that about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant it, Brick! Say, will you show me
how to make a blanket-roll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day passed swiftly for Dirk, eager as he
was for the morning that would mark the beginning
of the Long Trail hike. He was kept
busy getting his outfit into shape and seeing
that everything was in order; but he found time
now and again to study the map posted on the
wall. The names on it gave him a thrill that
he could not have explained&mdash;Flint Island, Lake
Moosehorn, the Chain of Ponds, even the few
scattered towns that lay among the folds of the
hills that skirted Mount Kinnecut. He was a
Long Trailer now!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>When dusk fell, and the whippoorwills could
be heard trilling in the thickets, the Lenape tribe
draped their blankets about them and trooped to
council. There was no happier or prouder member
of that tribe than Dirk Van Horn when, at
the time for awards and coups, he rose and was
given his honor emblem before the throne of the
Chief. It seemed impossible that little more
than a week had passed since he had first landed
on the Lenape campus. So many wonderful
things had happened that he felt a different person
from the&mdash;as he thought, looking back&mdash;pitifully
ignorant tenderfoot who had tried to
buy Brick Ryan&rsquo;s friendship with an expensive
gift. He had that friendship now, but he had
won it as a man should.</p>
<p>He drifted off to sleep clutching his new
honor, and when he awoke at dawn, rose and
sewed it carefully on the front of the sweater
that he would wear on the trail. Brick Ryan
was astir too, dressing in his worn hiking clothes
and rolling his blankets into a neat pack to be
strapped over his shoulders. He winked over at
Dirk and whispered: &ldquo;The pennant is still safe,
by gollies! I pinned it to my pajama shirt with
a big blanket-pin!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>The eight trailers were off up the mountainside
before nine o&rsquo;clock, after a brief but
thorough inspection by their leader. They
travelled in close marching order, for as Sagamore
Wise-Tongue explained, they were like a
war-party and must not lose their strength
through straggling or getting out of touch with
each other. It might be necessary, when they
were in wilder country, to put out scouts, but
since the road to Indian Glen was well known
to them, they would take it in regular stages.</p>
<p>Although Dirk&rsquo;s unaccustomed blanket-roll
was heavy and grew heavier as the morning wore
on, his heart was light. He joined in the songs
of the gay trailers as they threaded their way
through the trees on the slope above camp, pausing
as they reached the road at Fiddler&rsquo;s Elbow
and taking a last glance at the placid waters of
the lake and the white tents they were leaving
behind. Dirk laughed aloud as he thought of all
the adventures he would have before he again
caught sight of Camp Lenape. But had he
guessed that his life would be more than once in
wild danger on the path that lay before him, he
might well have shivered instead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>Up and down, over one ridge after another of
the Lenape range, the boys took their way, resting
now and then for a few moments in the
shade beside some bubbling mountain spring.
Mr. Carrigan, in the lead, bearing a first-aid kit
and many other necessities in the knapsack over
which his blankets were strapped, strode along
silently, ever on the alert for some wilderness
creature that he might point out to his eager followers.
Once he pointed out the marks of a fox,
and several times their progress stirred up a
covey of stupid, drumming partridge. And in
one breathless instant, before they came to the
end of the forest, he paused and pointed through
the trees. Dirk caught a glimpse of a swift-moving
dun-colored animal that with a flick of
its stubby tail was off in long easy leaps to the
shelter of the far thickets&mdash;a young deer, the
first he had ever seen in its native haunts.</p>
<p>He marched beside Brick and Ugly Brown,
the young, snub-nosed lad whose blunt, sun-burnt
face was somewhat likable in its very ugliness.
He remembered that these two, with
Kipper Dabney, had hazed him one moonlight
night&mdash;long ago, it seemed&mdash;but he made no
mention to them of that night when he had
leaped, blindfolded, over Indian Cliff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this Glen like that we&rsquo;re heading for,
Ugly?&rdquo; Dirk asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you ever been there? Say, it&rsquo;s a swell
place. We hike over here lots of times. Whillikers,
I&rsquo;m ready for a swim there right now,
even if the water feels as if it had just melted
from snow. It&rsquo;s called Pot-Hole Glen because
down below, the water has run across the rocks
so fast that there are a bunch of deep, smooth
holes worn down by pebbles whirlin&rsquo; around&mdash;right
through solid rock. It used to be an old
Indian camping place, I&rsquo;ve heard. We&rsquo;ll be
there soon, right after we cut across the fields
over yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that moment Mr. Carrigan turned off the
dusty road and cut through a meadow where a
herd of white-faced cows grazed. Dirk climbed
the rail fence slowly, for he was hot and more
than a little tired by the march; but he joined
in the whoops of his companions as they raced
the short distance that separated them from the
goal of their noonday pause and the swim that
was to come. And thus Dirk Van Horn came
to Pot-Hole Glen, which he was never in his
life to remember without a chill of horror creeping
up his spine&mdash;the horror of strangling death.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE WATCHER AGAIN</span></h2>
<p>The little plateau above the Glen was a
pleasant place enough&mdash;a smooth, shadowy
stretch of greensward marked here and there
with the remains of more than one Lenape campfire.
Here the trailers paused only long enough
to cast off their blanket-packs, and then raced in
a body for the steep, twining path leading down
the wall carved out in past ages by the running
stream at its foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a swim!&rdquo; was the cry as, helter-skelter,
the boys scrambled down the path that
zigzagged through the underbrush.</p>
<p>Dirk paused at the bottom of the cleft, and
falling slightly behind the others, searched for
the pot-holes that Ugly Brown had described.
There they were&mdash;smooth shafts of varying
widths, sunken into the rocky floor over which
the stream trickled softly. Taking a stick, Dirk
probed one of them, and found at the bottom a
few water-worn stones whose action had drilled,
in the course of many decades, a deep hole in
solid granite.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest hole of all is under the falls,&rdquo;
Brick Ryan shouted from below him. &ldquo;Come
on, my son&mdash;all the other guys are gettin&rsquo; wet
already!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared from sight at a turn in the
path leading down-stream, from whence Dirk
could hear the boisterous shouts of his comrades
rising above the splashing roar of falling water.
None the less, he did not hasten, for the wonders
of the Glen were too many to be hastily passed
over.</p>
<p>He walked slowly, gazing at the many-colored
flowers and unknown trees that arched the
stream. Several hundred yards down, the path
wound about a steep drop over which the water
boiled and bubbled&mdash;a miniature Niagara. From
his place, Dirk could look directly down into a
seething basin hollowed in the rock. Below this
fell away the bed of the stream in an incline of
sheeted, mossy shale, upon which sprawled the
naked forms of the trailers. Wild Willie Sanders,
with ear-splitting yells, was coasting down
the slide head first, and landed in the broad pool
below like a noisy otter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>Spray from the falls sprinkled Dirk&rsquo;s face,
and he hurried to strip off his dusty garments
and join in the fun. As he took his place on the
slide, the rills of water from the side of the falls
were so icy that he cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brr-r-r! Boy, talk about cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get warmed up swimming down here in the
pool,&rdquo; advised Sagamore Carrigan, who was
floating about in the crystal water beneath the
slide. &ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t feel it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk watched Spaghetti Megaro, who was
plunging a long pole into the great pot-hole
directly underneath the falls. The pole sank out
of sight, and shortly after shot into the air, to
be caught by the Italian lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s plenty deep, you bet!&rdquo; grinned
Megaro. &ldquo;They call this one the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron.
Some shower-bath if you get in this tub!
Once when I was here, Wally Rawn got in and
tried to dive down to bottom&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t find
no bottom, not at all. He got out plenty quick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Dirk hastily removed himself from the brink
of the treacherous-looking hole, and joined the
divers who plunged into the pebble-bottomed
pool below. The swim period was short, not only
because the hikers were hungry, but because the
water was so chill that too long exposure might
be dangerous to health. After a brisk rub-down
the trailers, glowing with vim, donned their cast-off
clothes and started for the plateau above,
where Cowboy Platt was already building a
small cooking-fire for the noonday meal.</p>
<p>Lingering behind alone, Dirk dressed slowly,
pausing now and then to watch the flight of a
bird, or to mark some strange formation of rock
along the walls of the Glen. At last he picked
up his dripping towel and started up the path to
rejoin his friends.</p>
<p>When he came once more to the bend directly
above the falls, he paused for a last look at the
impressive sight. As he stared down at the
racing waters, a clump of star-shaped flowers on
a tough-leafed bush caught his eye. He had
never seen such strange bright blossoms before,
but Sagamore Carrigan could tell him all about
them. It struck him that it would be a good
thing to get some and take them with him to the
others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Spreading his feet firmly on the slippery path,
he reached down to snatch the plant from its
perch in a crevice in the rocky cliff. It was too
far. He knelt, and dropping one leg over to
balance himself, made a second attempt. Still
the nodding flowers were a tantalizingly few
inches from the tips of his fingers. Tossing his
head with annoyance, he made a swift swoop.
As his hand touched the fringe of the bush, he
felt the earth beneath his weight stir and slip.</p>
<p>In sudden terror, he dropped the fragment
of the bush and dug in the toes of his heavy
shoes, painfully trying to scramble back to
safety. He grunted with the effort; but inch by
inch the treacherous loose dirt gave way. A
fearful glance over his shoulder, and he shut his
eyes, dizzied by the hissing rush of the leaping
rapids beneath his kicking legs. A rattle of
stones; and then, with a despairing shriek, he
plunged backward into the foaming falls!</p>
<p>The breath was knocked from his chest as he
struck the seething surface of the giant pot-hole&mdash;the
Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron! Down, down he sank,
freezing water filling his nose and open mouth
and shutting off all chance of summoning help.
The sunshine was far above him, seen dimly
through a glassy green froth, and the roar of
the rattling falls was drumming in his ears.</p>
<p>Desperately he kicked his leaden feet and
fought his way upward, the blood hammering in
his veins. One outstretched arm caught at the
slippery edge of the hole and clung fiercely.</p>
<p>Upon his unsheltered head, battering drops fell
like hailstones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>He had barely time to suck in a mouthful of
air when the force of the spinning current tore
his handhold loose, and again he dropped into
the Cauldron&rsquo;s depths. This time he felt weaker,
chilled by the glacial stream and beaten by its
pounding force. It was dark now. Dimly he
wondered if they would ever find his body in
that bottomless well....</p>
<p>An unseen hand was gripping him by the hair,
hauling him upward toward light and life.
Again the bullets of water struck his face and
throat, but strong arms were about his shoulders.
His chest scraped against the jagged margin of
the pool; like a sodden bag of meal, he was pulled
out of the clutch of that grim torrent.</p>
<p>He gasped, spat, and rolled over on his back.
Somewhere above him, a bird was whistling. He
opened one eye. Bending over him, with a
serious look on his freckled face, was Brick Ryan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alive, my lad? Gorries, say you&rsquo;re
all right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk choked, and tried to sit up, but fell back
weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m safe! It was horrible, down
there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t try to talk. Take it easy for a
minute. There, that better? Gee, you sure must
have had a bad time of it! I was comin&rsquo; along
down the creek to see what was keepin&rsquo; you, and
heard you yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was&mdash;trying to get some of those flowers
up there, and slipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Above him, through his moist eyelashes, he
saw the coveted blossoms swaying slightly in the
midday breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! Well, that&rsquo;s called rhododendron, and
it&rsquo;s against the law to pick it in this state! If
you&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo; better, I&rsquo;ll help you up to camp,
and we&rsquo;ll dry out your duds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fearing that delay might bring severe consequences,
Dirk crawled to his feet, and shivering
in his sodden garments, allowed himself to
be led up-stream, leaning heavily upon the lad
who had pulled him from that deadly bath. At
the foot of the path leading to the camping
place, he turned and faced his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brick,&rdquo; he said soberly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve saved my
life. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t put it in words, but if ever
there&rsquo;s anything&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-haired boy grinned and patted his
arm. &ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; he muttered gruffly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
have done the same if it had been me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the same&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, old son, before you freeze to death.
Climb, my lad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the summit, the rest of the trailers were
lying about on their packs, and there was a brisk
smell of wood-smoke and frying bacon in the air.
Mr. Carrigan leaped to his feet as he saw the two
boys, and without asking for any explanation,
had Dirk&rsquo;s dripping garments stripped off in
short order, and after a rough rub-down he was
stowed between a pair of warm blankets and told
to rest.</p>
<p>Dirk had been living in the open for more than
a week now, and long before his wet clothes were
dried before the fire, he felt none the worse for
the mishap that might so easily have taken his
life. The councilor brewed him a cup of warm,
heartening soup that brought his strength back
quickly; and when an hour had passed he convinced
the man that he was himself again and
ready to travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have far to go now,&rdquo; announced
Sagamore Carrigan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a couple miles
to the river and Skinner&rsquo;s Ferry, where the
canoes are; and from there we can paddle to
Kittahannock Lodge in no time&mdash;that&rsquo;s where
we stop for the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Once more the hikers put their blanket-rolls
over their shoulders and set out, following the
dirt road that led westward from the Glen
toward the river. The councilor now had a hard
time to keep them together, so anxious were they
to reach the ferry where the canoes waited for
them; but he held them to the same steady pace.
Dirk was forced to admit to himself that he was
tired now, and he was glad when they crossed a
stone bridge over a creek and came in sight of
the ferry.</p>
<p>An unpainted, low frame building with a roof
of &ldquo;shakes,&rdquo; or shingles split with an ax, lay
beside a rude wharf at which was moored a flat-bottomed
scow. Such was the ancient Skinner&rsquo;s
Ferry that dated back to Revolutionary days.
On the wharf lay the three Lenape canoes, ready
for their voyage into the wilderness. There was
now no thought of restraining the eager lads, and
Dirk, with the rest, broke into a run that ended
on the narrow wharf. An old and bent ferryman
came from the house to announce that the equipment
brought from camp on the wagon awaited
them within.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Now began a busy half-hour of packing and
launching the light craft. It was settled that
Dirk and Brick Ryan would handle the <i>Sachem</i>,
in which would be stowed the cooking outfit,
rations, and odds and ends of camp outfit, while
the other members of the party divided into two
crews of three campers each to manage the <i>Red
Fox</i> and the <i>Whiffenpoof</i>. When the equipment
had all been stowed inside the rubber tarpaulins
and lashed firmly to the thwarts, so that
it would not be wet or lost in case of an upset,
Dirk and his partner each took an end of their
vessel and dropped it overside into the sheltered
water below the wharf. As Dirk climbed into
his place at the bow, he took care to make sure
that his first misadventure with his canoe at
Lenape should not be repeated; and in the wake
of the other two craft, they shoved forth into the
stream, shouted a farewell to the bent ferryman,
and began paddling swiftly.</p>
<p>Mr. Carrigan, in the stern of the <i>Red Fox</i>,
led the way, with Megaro at the bow paddle and
Ugly Brown riding amidships. At a distance
of a few lengths followed the <i>Whiffenpoof</i>,
carrying Cowboy Platt, Saunders, and Steve
Link. Dirk dipped and pulled his paddle in fast
time, for their course lay diagonally across the
current, which at this place rippled whitely over
its stony bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make for the point!&rdquo; shouted the councilor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Kittahannock Lodge, where we sleep
tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead the broad river made a turn, and at the
bend a tall white flagpole rose from a clump of
trees, tinged with sunset gold. Dirk gave it a
glance, and bent to his straining task, while Brick
fulfilled the delicate job of keeping the light
vessel on its path. On flew the <i>Sachem</i>, as if
glad to be afloat and bearing her owner farther
and farther toward the northern wilds.</p>
<p>Once Dirk paused momentarily to catch his
breath. He looked back to the shore that they
were leaving. A road wound along the edge of
the river, above the ferry, and along it crawled
a small automobile with a plume of dust rising
behind it. Dirk saw it only for a moment before
it disappeared from sight behind a low hill. But
he was sure, as he turned again to his paddling,
that the car was a blue sedan, and that he knew
the slight figure of the man that hunched over
the wheel. It was the mysterious fisherman they
had surprised on the shore of Lake Lenape some
days before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE TRAP ON FLINT ISLAND</span></h2>
<p>Sagamore Carrigan and his trailers
were greeted in hearty fashion by the
campers of Kittahannock Lodge, and the director,
who each year was glad to extend his hospitality
to the Lenape Long Trailers, offered an
empty tent-house to the canoe party. He also
invited them to supper at the lodge, but when
Mr. Carrigan explained that they had provisions
with them, assigned them a grassy spot above the
river. Here, after they had washed up in the
camp bath-house, the trailers were drawn about
the fire by the aroma of Cowboy Platt&rsquo;s cookery,
and attacked with no little gusto the meal he
handed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>As soon as each man had washed his plate and
fork, the trailers joined in the campfire merriment
of the Kittahannock tribe within the lodge
of hewn timber, on the walls of which were hung
many examples of their woodcraft skill and collections
of natural objects. The band was a
lively and merry crowd, and the Lenape lads
joined in the fun in friendly spirit. Games and
stunts passed the time until the call to quarters
sounded, and the eight hikers sought their cabin
sleepily with many thoughts of their exciting
first day on the trail.</p>
<p>Sagamore Carrigan yawned as he pulled his
blankets over him and switched off his flash-lantern.
&ldquo;Not many stars out,&rdquo; he remarked;
&ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t like the way the campfire smoke
hung low in the chimney tonight. I wouldn&rsquo;t be
at all surprised if we had a wet cruise tomorrow,
fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk woke in the night to hear a splatter of
drops on the roof of the tent-house; and he fell
asleep again thinking drowsily that the leader&rsquo;s
words had come true. The next morning
dawned mistily over a wet world, and a swirling
fog hung low over the river, shrouding the
farther shore. The gloomy weather, though,
penetrated no deeper than the ponchos of the
Lenape boys, who after a warming breakfast,
were afloat at an early hour. In a mysterious
silence they pushed off into the overhung waters
to continue their cruise up-stream, keeping close
together so that no canoe should be separated
from the others in the fog.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>After an hour&rsquo;s stiff paddling against the
stubborn current, they saw the sun shine through
once or twice, and the fog cleared away. But it
was plain to be seen that the rain would continue
steadily throughout the day. Through the downpour,
Dirk caught sight of the river banks, now
much closer together than they had been at Skinner&rsquo;s
Ferry. Shallow rapids became much more
frequent, and Brick in the stern had to exercise
unusual care to see that the <i>Sachem&rsquo;s</i> bottom
was not ripped on some jagged rock.</p>
<p>Dirk, paddling doggedly with his arms thrust
through the slits in his rubber poncho, felt the
muscles of his shoulders stiffening with the unwonted
labor; and he was happy when, in the
middle of the morning, the little fleet came into
sight of the white houses of the small river town
of Port Jermyn. They tied up at the wharf
where the main street of the town ended, and
strolled about through the rain-swept village
while the councilor, assisted by Steve Link, purchased
the supplies that would be their sole provisions
until their return from the wilds into
which they were about to plunge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>The stop at Port Jermyn, short as it was,
refreshed the paddlers, and Dirk found that he
had gained his second wind. He still retained
his place in the bow, however, for he did not feel
that he owned the skill necessary to guide the
<i>Sachem</i> through the ever-increasing shallows of
the river above the town. Feeling that he had
left civilization behind for some time to come,
he worked with a will, chewing a piece of butterscotch
and waiting patiently for the signal that
would mean a halt for the midday meal.</p>
<p>Shortly after noon, Mr. Carrigan beckoned to
the following canoeists to turn off the main
stream into the mouth of a wide creek flowing
from the west. A few hundred yards from the
outlet, they turned their craft toward the bank,
and climbed out stiffly to stretch and gather dry
wood for a smoky fire built beneath the shielding
branches of a large oak. The canoes were
turned on their sides, ponchos were taken off and
stretched on sticks above the openings, and
within these snug shelters the trailers lounged on
their backs and lazily devoured heaping plates of
beans and bread and slightly damp cookies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-all are goin&rsquo; to fix some spaghetti for
supper, in your honor, Wop!&rdquo; Cowboy Platt
twitted Megaro. &ldquo;How will you like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K., I bet!&rdquo; answered the Italian boy.
&ldquo;Say, maybe I catch some bullheads in Lake
Moosehorn, and if I get more than fifty, I give
you one to eat in your honor!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>Dirk laughed, not because the joke was good,
but because he was well fed and warm and happy
to be with such a game crowd of campers.
Although the rain might have dampened the
holiday moods of many boys, not one of these
lads had uttered a word of complaint. Later
that eventful day, Dirk was to look back wistfully
at that scene; for neither he nor Brick
Ryan was fated to partake of that contemplated
meal of fish and spaghetti on the shore of Lake
Moosehorn.</p>
<p>Refreshed and rested, the boys broke camp
and prepared to leave the broad river behind.
Dirk recalled that this stream they were now
following must be the Sweetwater Creek shown
on the map that Sagamore Carrigan carried in
his breast pocket. If so, it would lead to the
first of the Chain of Ponds, where the first
portage would begin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>His surmise was correct. Close together, their
bows sometimes brushing overhanging limbs of
trees as they rounded a bend in the creek and a
new reach of rain-spattered water met the paddlers&rsquo;
eyes, the three canoes wended up-stream.
On either side the walls of the forest closed in
about them, and in some places it was as gloomy
as though it had been nightfall instead of broad
afternoon. Before two miles had slipped past
their dripping paddles, the creek ended in a
rough dam of logs that marked the outlet of the
lowest of the ponds; and here was the first
portage.</p>
<p>It was a short one, merely circling the dam
and so to another launching on the dark mirror-like
water of the pond. The boys landed and
hauled their canoes ashore; then, without bothering
to remove the contents, they each seized an
end and carried the craft up a narrow trail,
slippery with weeds and mud, to the edge of the
pond. Once more afloat, they pulled through the
dripping rain in the rippling wake of the <i>Red
Fox</i>. Dirk, brushing the drops from his glistening
face, wondered how the leader could find his
way through the winding passage. Reeds and
ugly, misshapen snags jutted upward from the
murky, black bottom covered with dead leaves,
and somehow brought a chill to the boy in the
canoe, so close were they beneath his paddle. He
wondered what would happen to any daring soul
that might try to swim in the dark forbidding
water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>Sagamore Carrigan knew his way, however,
and unerringly came out at the end where the
next portage began. This was a long one, for
these two ponds were connected only by a
swampy trickle that wound across hummocks of
mud. For half a mile the boys threaded through
the ankle-deep muck; and though the councilor
sent Spaghetti Megaro back to bear a part of the
overburdened <i>Sachem</i>, Dirk was ready to call a
halt before a third of the way had been traversed.
Gritting his teeth, he tried to forget the cutting,
swaying load pressing his aching shoulders,
meanwhile thanking his stars that his shoes were
strong and waterproof.</p>
<p>By the end of the afternoon all the trailers,
although they would not have admitted it under
torture, were heartily sick of ponds and portages.
Everlastingly climbing in and out of the vessels,
slipping and sliding through an overgrown footpath
with one end of a staunch canoe on one&rsquo;s
shoulder and dripping branches catching at garments
and whipping into one&rsquo;s face, all in a
semi-darkness that depressed the heartiest spirit&mdash;it
seemed to all of them that they could not
last out another hour of this winding progress
through the lowlands, when from the van came
Sagamore Wise-Tongue&rsquo;s cheering cry: &ldquo;Lake
Moosehorn ahead!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>The broad expanse of clear water uplifted the
souls of all. Dirk, feeling glad that reeds and
snags and winding dark ponds were left behind
at last, threw himself on a grassy bank beside
his canoe, breathing a sigh of relief. It was late
in the afternoon and the rain had slackened to
a filmy drizzle. Across from them loomed the
hump of Flint Island, while over the tree-clad
summit of Mount Kinnecut toward the west, the
descending sun was bravely trying to show forth
before sinking into night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be pitching camp inside an hour, men,&rdquo;
said the leader. &ldquo;Our headquarters will be at
the old spot at the far end of the lake, up by
that tall dead spruce. From there we&rsquo;ll have to
use our feet instead of our paddles, to make the
summit of Kinnecut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; remarked Ugly Brown. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
usin&rsquo; my feet all day. I don&rsquo;t mind hikin&rsquo;, if I
don&rsquo;t have to carry a canoe with me. Why, after
today, I&rsquo;ll probably race up to the top of that
little mountain tomorrow just to get an appetite
for breakfast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never even pitch camp before dark if
you yearlings don&rsquo;t stop argufyin&rsquo; and get
started,&rdquo; drawled Cowboy. &ldquo;I want lots of
wood cut for the fire, and somebody mentioned
he was goin&rsquo; to hook some fish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll move along, then, and do our
resting when we get to camp,&rdquo; said Mr. Carrigan.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old earth that will be your bed
tonight, if I don&rsquo;t cut some spruce tips for
mattresses&mdash;so let&rsquo;s be on our way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Red Fox</i> and the <i>Whiffenpoof</i> pushed
out on the lake for the last lap of the day&rsquo;s long
journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Brick Ryan, paddle in hand,
&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to stir, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; Dirk rose stiffly, and
stretched. &ldquo;Gollies, I hate to move, though. I
could go to sleep right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here, my bucko.&rdquo; The red-headed boy
playfully prodded his canoe-mate in the ribs.
&ldquo;Stir your stumps. Look, the other guys are
almost out of sight around Flint Island. Old
Wise-Tongue is wavin&rsquo; for us to come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two foremost canoes vanished behind the
bulk of the little island as the <i>Sachem</i> pushed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steer over along the shore of the island, will
you?&rdquo; asked Dirk, after a moment. &ldquo;I thought
I saw something moving in the bushes. It looked
like&mdash;&mdash;See it? Why, it&rsquo;s a man! And he&rsquo;s
waving to us! What do you suppose he wants?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>He quickened his stroke, and they pulled
toward the rocky edge where the waterline of
the lake marked the island. A low, hoarse cry
rose from the twilight of the thickets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! Help me, you come help! I caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s head was visible through a gap between
the trees. The hair was long and black,
the skin dark, and the features that could be
made out were rugged and wild-looking. The
voice was that of one in pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s an Indian! Hurry, Brick&mdash;he&rsquo;s
hurt. Maybe a tree fell on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you better take it slow till
you know what&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! He needs us right away. Here&rsquo;s
a good place to land.&rdquo; Dirk leaped ashore as he
spoke, and ran to the spot where the Indian lay
moaning in his broken pidgin-English.</p>
<p>As he approached, the man rose to his feet and
leaped at the boy like a wildcat. As the outstretched
arms caught Dirk about the shoulders
and threw him backward, he realized, too late,
what was happening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get away, Brick!&rdquo; he screamed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
trick!&rdquo; He fell on the rocky ground, with the
strange Indian upon him, holding his body so
that he could not move an inch, nor see what
Brick was doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t get away,&rdquo; said a cruel, level
voice. &ldquo;And if you yelp once more, young Van
Horn, you&rsquo;ll get a bullet in your noisy mouth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk felt the heavy body above him suddenly
removed; the Indian was rising to his feet. The
boy staggered upward, and was again thrown to
the earth by a fierce thrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie there and cool off!&rdquo; ordered the unseen.
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve got a gun on you, and on your smart
pal, too. Get out of that canoe quick, Red, if
you know what&rsquo;s good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t have that pistol on me,&rdquo; muttered
Brick Ryan savagely through clenched
teeth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last Dirk made out the form of the man
who, with the aid of the rascally Indian, had
trapped them. He felt only a dull throb of surprise
as he recognized him. Brick&rsquo;s warning at
Lake Lenape had been justified, after all. The
mysterious fisherman had tracked them down
and caught them alone at last.</p>
<p>The man deliberately walked up to Brick, the
gleaming nose of his pistol showing in his right
hand. With his left he thrust swiftly upward.
There was the sound of a blow against flesh, and
Brick fell heavily upon the pebbled shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lie there, both of you. Now, Mink,&rdquo; their
captor addressed the Indian, &ldquo;dump that stuff
out of their canoe and put it in ours. We need
it more than that dumb bunch of kids up the
lake. Then tie up these two birds tight, and
dump them in too. We&rsquo;ve got to get away before
the ones up ahead come back to see what&rsquo;s
wrong. Wish I could see their faces when they
find out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what are you going to do with us?&rdquo;
asked Dirk hoarsely.</p>
<p>The stranger laughed unpleasantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
find out soon enough, kid. Ready, Mink? That&rsquo;s
good. Now, turn over that fancy red canoe and
shove it way out in the channel, so that when the
main gang come back, they&rsquo;ll know for sure that
these two wise little scouts are drowned to death
and sunk to the bottom of the lake!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">FIRE IN THE FOREST</span></h2>
<p>Trussed with light rope like a pair of fowl
ready for slaughter, the two boys were lifted
one by one in the Indian&rsquo;s arms and laid in the
bottom of his dirty canoe. Neither could speak,
for bandana handkerchiefs were knotted tightly
between their teeth, so that they had barely a
chance to breathe. They lay on the unyielding
ribs of the craft, which apparently leaked, for
several inches of chilly water sloshed about beneath
them and ran down their necks, soaking
their already damp clothing.</p>
<p>The tarpaulin-wrapped bundle containing the
provisions stolen from the Lenape trailers was
dumped next to their heads. The man with the
pistol crouched in the bow, his slicker thrown
open, now that the rain had stopped. His dark-skinned
henchman, whom he had called Mink,
cast another glance at the <i>Sachem</i>, which was
caught in the channel current and, bottom upward,
drifted toward the outlet. Then, seizing
his paddle, he pushed off the heavy-laden vessel
and began paddling furiously toward the far
shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>Although they were effectively hidden from
the eyes of any returning Lenape canoeists as
long as they kept the length of the island between
them, the two men kept a wary lookout until
they gained the shelter of the far shore, where
the deepening twilight hid them from any possibility
of discovery. Dirk, squirming painfully
in his bonds, could see only the body of the muscular
Mink above him, his moving head and arms
outlined against the purple sky, in which one star
already gleamed. He could hear Brick Ryan
breathing heavily beside him, and bit at his gag
angrily, realizing that he could help neither his
comrade nor himself. If only he had departed
with the other members of the party, the two
desperate men would not have had opportunity
to snare them as they had done. It had been all
his own fault, Dirk condemned himself. If only
he had listened to Brick&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>But why were they thus trapped and taken
from their friends toward an unknown fate, leaving
an overturned canoe behind to give the cruel
impression that they had drowned? What was
the meaning of it? Why had this man, who now
sat slumped in the bow of the leaky canoe, followed
Dirk so relentlessly into the wilds?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>He puzzled until his head throbbed, but could
piece out no answer to those questions. The
steady rhythm of the paddle might have lulled
him off to a fitful stupor, so weary was he; but
the filthy water in the bottom of the canoe
slapped him again and again into wakefulness.
It seemed as if hours passed before the canoe
made a sudden swerve shoreward, and the bottom
beneath him scraped on a gravel spit of land.</p>
<p>It was already quite dark. The two lads were
bundled out of the canoe and were glad to be
relieved from their painful position. Had their
captor not untied all their bonds save those holding
their hands behind their backs, they would
have fallen over when they were first put on their
feet; as it was, Dirk was forced to lean against
a tree to keep himself erect.</p>
<p>The Indian&rsquo;s master pulled the gags from their
mouths with a warning. &ldquo;Not a word out of
either of you! Not that it would do you any
good, at that. You don&rsquo;t know where you are,
but I can tell you it&rsquo;s miles from anybody that
could hear you, or would care what I did to you
if you yelled. So be good little kids and follow
my half-breed friend Mink. And remember, I
still have my gun handy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>The half-breed, who during this time had been
pulling his canoe ashore and hiding it in a pile of
brush near by, now silently raised the pack of
provisions to his shoulder and began stolidly
tramping through the darkness. The driven boys
stumbled in his wake, too weary to know or care
where the overgrown path might lead. Behind
them marched the nameless man, who now and
then uttered an oath as he tripped over a root or
sank ankle-deep in a forest pool.</p>
<p>After half a mile, the guard dropped so far
behind that Dirk ventured a cautious whisper in
the direction of his friend; although, since the
half-breed looked back from time to time, it was
impossible to attempt a flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think they&rsquo;re taking us,
Brick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick shook his head hopelessly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know&mdash;too
dark to see. I think we&rsquo;re on the west side
of Moosehorn, but maybe not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I was such a fool as to let them
take us so easily. If I&rsquo;d listened to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, my lad.&rdquo; Brick&rsquo;s voice was
somehow cheering. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t hurt you. Me,
maybe, but not you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;you know why they captured
us? I&rsquo;ve been trying to figure it out. Why, why
did they do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean to tell me you don&rsquo;t know? Why,
I&rsquo;ve been suspectin&rsquo; it since the first time I saw
that guy with the gun. Don&rsquo;t you realize that he
kidnaped you so that he could make your dad
pay a wad of money to get you back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn gasped incredulously. &ldquo;But&mdash;kidnapers!
Why, my father isn&rsquo;t a wealthy
man! He&rsquo;s quite well off, but even if he is president
of a bank, he doesn&rsquo;t own all the money
in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, wouldn&rsquo;t he give all he&rsquo;s got to have
you back home safe again? Sure, he&rsquo;d do that,
and this tough bird that&rsquo;s got us counts on it.
No, you&rsquo;re safe until he gets some ransom for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, there!&rdquo; commanded an angry voice,
with a curse. Their guard had caught up to
them, and a wave of his weapon put a stop to
their whispered comments. But Dirk at last
understood why he was a prisoner. He understood,
too, the strange invitation of the man when
they had surprised him at Lake Lenape. He had
tried to lure them away from their friends, and
failing in that, had kept watch on the boy&rsquo;s every
movement. Seeing that a capture was impossible
so close to the camp, he had somehow found out
about the long trail expedition, and no doubt
hiring the villainous half-breed Mink to help him
in his criminal purpose, had gone before them and
waylaid them at Flint Island by a ruse, at a time
when the two boys were by chance separated
from the main party.</p>
<p>At long last the man ahead stopped and put
down his burden. A dim shape loomed before
them, a rough hut of logs chinked with mud, that
was evidently the dwelling of the half-breed. He
fumbled with the latch on the door. The man in
the slicker tossed away a glowing cigarette, and
pushed them inside, harshly ordering Mink to
shut the door and cover the window before lighting
the lantern.</p>
<p>In the glow of the battered oil-lantern that the
half-breed brought forth, the boys looked about
with half-shut eyes. A heap of cured skins lay
in one corner, and the single room smelled vilely
of stale smoke and damp walls and animal remains.
The Indian knelt on the hearth of the
rough stone fireplace, but his master stopped him
with a word.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quit that! Do you want to tell the world
where we are? They could see that smoke ten
miles away! We&rsquo;ll grab a cold supper tonight,
and tomorrow when you&rsquo;re here with them, don&rsquo;t
take any chances, or you&rsquo;ll end up in the jug!
There must be some stuff in that bundle that we
can eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sank down on a stool and lit another cigarette,
while the half-breed rummaged in the
Lenape provision-sack and discovered some cans
of fruit and vegetables, which he opened with the
blade of an ax. The two prisoners, too tired to
care what befell, sank to the floor and lay there
half-asleep, until the Indian roused them roughly
and shoved food at them, untying their chilled
hands so that they might eat.</p>
<p>Hungrily, they wolfed down the unappetizing
fare. Cold corn from a can, dry bread, and still
dryer prunes do not constitute an ideal repast
for famished boys, but they made the best of
what was given them. Brick, indeed, was so
strengthened by the meal, poor as it was, that his
Irish fighting spirit came back to him. Chewing
a crust, he lifted his head and directed a fierce
glance at their enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go to jail for life for doin&rsquo; this!&rdquo; he
challenged.</p>
<p>The man wiped his mouth leisurely, rose, and
strode over to the hapless lads.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;Still full of pep, eh? Well, Redhead, it won&rsquo;t
take us long to put that out of you! Young Mr.
Millionaire Van Horn here will be all right if
Papa comes across tomorrow, but you ain&rsquo;t worth
a nickel to me, and don&rsquo;t forget it!&rdquo; His cold
blue eyes widened. &ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s that thing
stickin&rsquo; out of your shirt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick drew back, fumbling at his breast, where
the honor of Lenape, in the shape of a rumpled
bit of green-and-white bunting, had been carried
throughout the journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;nothin&rsquo;, just a flag,&rdquo; he muttered, trying
to stuff it out of sight.</p>
<p>His tormentor laughed jeeringly. &ldquo;Just a
flag, eh?&rdquo; With a sudden movement, he tore it
from the boy&rsquo;s grasp. After a slighting glance,
he crumpled it in his fist, strode to the door, and
tossed the Lenape pennant into the mud outside
the step.</p>
<p>He whirled to meet Brick&rsquo;s leap. Dirk sprang
to help, but was disdainfully pushed aside by the
silent half-breed. When next he looked, Brick
lay sprawled out on the floor, with an ugly red
blotch on his forehead and helpless rage crackling
in his eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The man&rsquo;s doubled fist threatened further
punishment. Then, with another empty laugh,
he turned on his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep, you brats,&rdquo; he flung out over
his shoulder. &ldquo;Toss them some blankets, Mink.
I&rsquo;ve got to get some rest if I&rsquo;m hoofing over to
Yanceyville in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blanket-rolls of the two trailers had been
taken from their canoe along with the larger
pack; and these were now thrown over them as
they crouched in one corner of the hut. The
walls and crude floor-boards let in draughts of
chill, damp night air, and they hunched together
dumbly for warmth and companionship. With
the moaning of the wind through the trees above
their heads as a doleful lullaby, they sank into
the despairing slumber of the captive.</p>
<p>After a century of nightmares in that dark,
noisome hole, Dirk stirred his cramped limbs and
opened his eyes to find a ray of daylight slanting
through the single window. His enemy stood
with one hand on the latch of the door, giving
parting orders to his servile guide. The man&rsquo;s
pasty face showed the effects of an existence that
was not natural to him, whose haunts were those
of the city. His serge suit was stained and
creased, while his cheek bore a clotted scratch
where he had scraped it against the projecting
limb of a tree during the dark passage of the
previous night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>&ldquo;And remember,&rdquo; he was snarling, &ldquo;that you
ain&rsquo;t to let those brats out of your sight for a
minute! They&rsquo;re slippery little imps, especially
that red-headed one. If all goes well and the
old man comes across with the money, I&rsquo;ll be back
with your share by night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You not try to fool me, eh? You pay me
what you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Mink. We&rsquo;re partners on this&mdash;split
the dough fifty-fifty. I&rsquo;ll telegraph old Van
Horn from Yanceyville, and if he&rsquo;s got any
sense, he&rsquo;ll send the cash by wire right away.
It&rsquo;s a cinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed out into the sunlight, scratched a
match, and began puffing the eternal cigarette.
As he disappeared, the Indian shrugged and set
about putting together a breakfast as cold and
cheerless as the meal of the previous night.</p>
<p>Miserably the boys roused themselves to face
another day of imprisonment, in the tumbledown
cabin of the half-breed, who handed food to them
silently and whose watchful, savage glare made
them break off each time they attempted to speak
to one another. In fact, so closely did he watch
their least move that Dirk, after an hour, gave
up all hope of finding any avenue of escape from
beneath the half-breed&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>More than two hours had passed, Dirk judged,
since the departure of their nameless foe, who
was evidently now well on his way to Yanceyville
on his nefarious errand of attempting to
extort a large sum of money from Dirk&rsquo;s father
as a ransom. What would happen? Even if the
money were paid promptly, would this man free
them at once, or would he attempt some further
villainy to prevent them from putting the law
on his track as soon as they had won to civilization?</p>
<p>Mink, who had been sitting on his stool with
his back against the door, passing the time by
whittling idly at a stick of firewood, sat up suspiciously.
His nose was in the air, sniffing like
a hound that has lost the scent. He rose with
a clatter and paced, still sniffing, to the dead fireplace.
After a few seconds, he shrugged and
returned, apparently satisfied, to his post.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Dirk went back to his gloomy thoughts, which
were now turned toward his companions, who had
set out so blithely with him on the Long Trail.
Were they even now mourning his death and
Brick&rsquo;s, as victims of a canoe accident? He recalled
his clumsiness the first time the <i>Sachem</i>
was launched&mdash;no doubt they thought him still a
lubber who would upset his craft and drag his
friend with him to the watery depths. But Mr.
Carrigan was wise; and though their captors
were cunning, they had left several clues that
might be read. For instance, the provision-sack
had been tightly lashed within the canoe; Sagamore
Wise-Tongue would think it strange that
it had worked loose when the canoe overturned.
They had left no tracks, except a trampled spot
in the bushes on Flint Island, but perhaps, perhaps
the Lenape men had not given up hope.
Their stock of food was gone, but they would
find some way to exist, even in the wilderness&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He woke from his reverie. Mink had again
jumped to his feet, nose in air. Dirk sniffed too.
Something stronger than the heavy odor of the
cabin was sifting through the chinks in the logs.
It smelled like the lodge at Lenape, in the
evening with the whole tribe gathered around the
fireplace&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>With a wild cry, the Indian threw open the
door, leaped across the threshold, and slammed it
behind his retreating form. A frozen instant of
hushed wonder&mdash;the smell became undeniable&mdash;a
smell of charring timber&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Dirk dashed for the window, but Brick was
before him. Together, the boys stared through
the dirty pane. The forest showed them no
danger signals, but from over their heads came
the thuds of a scrambling body and the low hiss
of flames in dry shingle-boards.</p>
<p>Brick turned to his friend, his freckled face
aglow with renewed hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This cabin must be afire, Dirk!&rdquo; he muttered,
trying to keep down the exultation in his
heart. &ldquo;Gollies, listen to that! The roof must
be blazin&rsquo; like sixty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true; rising above the beats of his heart,
the listening Dirk could hear the crackling of
hungry flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our chance!&rdquo; Brick&rsquo;s eyes were dancing.
&ldquo;Come on! Old Mink sure will be busy for a
minute, and he won&rsquo;t think about us. Now&rsquo;s
our chance to make a getaway!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE FLIGHT INTO THE HILLS</span></h2>
<p>The two captives were out the door of the
burning cabin in an instant, and broke wildly
for cover in the thickets beyond the clearing.</p>
<p>Dirk, as he fled, cast a desperate glance over
his shoulder. Mink, their half-breed guard, had
climbed somehow to the roof of his shanty, and
with his khaki shirt, which he had torn off in
haste, was striving to beat out the licking flames
that fed on the dry, rotten shakes. His back was
toward them, and he was so immersed in his
furious task that he took no notice of their flight.</p>
<p>With Brick at his side, running stealthily and
gasping for breath, he found himself beneath the
shadow of a clump of pines. Pausing now to
look about and get some feeling of the direction
of the lake where their friends must be, he was
startled by having his comrade seize his arm and
shake it roughly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gollies, how could I forget?&rdquo; the red-headed
lad panted. &ldquo;I left the flag back there at the
hut&mdash;the other guy chucked it in the mud last
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; urged Dirk. &ldquo;That Indian
will get us&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Sagamore Carrigan give it to me to
keep safe&mdash;it&rsquo;s the honor of Lenape, he said! I
got to get it! Say, Van, these birds don&rsquo;t want
me. It&rsquo;s you they&rsquo;re after&mdash;you keep runnin&rsquo;,
and maybe I&rsquo;ll catch up with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was off before Dirk could speak further,
racing back the way they had come, perhaps into
the very arms of the enraged Mink. Dirk, however,
had no intention of deserting his friend.
He could see nothing in the direction of the hut
save a thin column of greasy-looking smoke
through the trees. He threw himself on the
needle-carpeted earth, his chest heaving with
exertion and excitement. If Brick came back
this way, with the Indian after him, perhaps he
could divert his attention, lead him a chase
through the underbrush&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>A squawking flight of large birds, crows and
bluejays among them, swooped over his head.
He rose on his elbow to mark their noisy passage.
Not five yards off, the low scrub-oak bushes
rustled and parted, revealing a rusty-coated,
sharp-nosed animal with a brushy tail. It was a
fox. Dirk did not move; the fox saw him, but
cast only an incurious eye on him, and trotted
off swiftly as if on urgent business at a far place.</p>
<p>Dirk jumped to his feet. A curl of smoke
crept across the slanting bars of sunlight that fell
to the floor of the glade. A distant murmur like
a rising wind came to him, and his mouth went
dry with fear. Why wasn&rsquo;t Brick back? What
was happening there through the screening
forest?</p>
<p>He took a step forward, as if to run to his
comrade&rsquo;s assistance. As he did so, he caught
sight of Brick on the other side of the glade,
waved, and ran to his side. The Irish lad&rsquo;s face
was pale, but he clutched in one hand the bedraggled
banner he had risked recapture to save.</p>
<p>Dirk took his arm. &ldquo;Are you all right, old
fellow? Where is Mink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I fell down once, and he saw me, but he
couldn&rsquo;t get down from the roof. Say, some of
the bushes and trees are on fire&mdash;I could hear
&rsquo;em sizzle. Let&rsquo;s get out of here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way is the lake, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stop to think about that&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
got to run! Soon as he puts out the fire, that
Indian is goin&rsquo; to start trackin&rsquo; us down&mdash;they
can follow like a bloodhound!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t put it out soon. Look there!&rdquo;
Dirk pointed into the tree tops. The crackling
roar had grown louder now, and as they looked,
a leaping rope of flame bridged the gap between
two trees nearly overhead. A smoking twig
whirled to the ground beside them, starting a
slow spark in the dry pine-needles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell which way to go&mdash;but I think
the fire is between us and the lake! We must
get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to pull Brick forward, following the
direction taken by the fleeing fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, thanks for waitin&rsquo; for me,&rdquo; gasped
Brick. &ldquo;But you better&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your wind!&rdquo; Dirk fought his way
through a scratching barrier of brush. The
horror of a hissing wall of flames at their backs
put wings on his heels.</p>
<p>They labored in silence up a steep hillside,
crossed a rocky ridge, and scrambled down into
a blasted ravine on the other side. Dirk was
aware that his friend was muttering shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got to stop a minute! You can&rsquo;t hear the
fire now&mdash;get my wind&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both spoke softly, as if even now some enemy,
concealed near them, might overhear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Dirk replied, watching Brick sink
down upon a moss-covered ledge of rock. &ldquo;But
that Indian will be following us as soon as he
can, if he knows we&rsquo;ve gone this way. Maybe
we should go in another direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments passed in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew where the lake was,&rdquo; said Dirk
finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this creek here probably runs down
into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true&mdash;but as near as I can see, this is
the same one that goes right by the cabin. We&rsquo;d
only run right back into Mink&rsquo;s arms. Guess
we&rsquo;ve got to make for the hills. Then if one of
us climbs a tree, we can get our bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick sighed heavily, and Dirk stared at him.
Their adventures had put them both in sad case.
Garments were stained and torn, bareheaded and
grimed with dirt were they, looking like two
scarecrows. Dirk wondered why Brick was so
laggard in the flight. It was not like him to
drag behind. The boy&rsquo;s freckles stood out
against his white face, and his lip was trembling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>&ldquo;Know what I think?&rdquo; asked Dirk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
that man with the gun was the person that
started the fire. Of course he didn&rsquo;t do it on
purpose, but he was always smoking cigarettes
and throwing them away without putting them
out first. This morning, when he went away, he
was smoking. A spark probably caught somewhere
and set fire to the shack&mdash;it&rsquo;s a regular old
tinderbox. Well, shall we start again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m game,&rdquo; answered Brick; but he took his
time getting to his feet.</p>
<p>They began the second stage of their flight by
crossing the creek, where they paused for a hasty
draught of water, and then attacked the long
steady slope on the far side, toiling upward
through a dense growth of evergreens. It seemed
as if they would never get clear of the towering
trunks and branches that seemed to push down
upon their shoulders, smothering them and impeding
their way. When at last they attained
the height, Dirk was reluctantly forced to abandon
his plan to climb a tree and thus get a view
of the surrounding country. The lower branches
were still so far above his head that it would be
impossible for the most agile boy to get a foothold
on the smooth trunks.</p>
<p>He turned to Brick. &ldquo;Say, old lad, perhaps
if you give me a boost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off, seeing
the pain in his friend&rsquo;s drawn face. The
eyes were shifting feverishly above the hollow
cheeks, and the boy was biting his lip to keep
back a moan of anguish. &ldquo;Why, Brick, are you
hurt? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Brick swayed, and had Dirk not run to his side
to support his body, would have collapsed to the
ground. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;all right,&rdquo; he gasped out. &ldquo;You
go on&mdash;get to the top of the darned mountain&mdash;the
honor of the camp&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble? Are you sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fell down that time&mdash;the Indian was lookin&rsquo;&mdash;kind
of knocked my ankle over a rock&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He fell backward in his comrade&rsquo;s arms, and
Dirk realized that he had fainted.</p>
<p>That was Brick Ryan, all right&mdash;floundering
along gamely without a word, although his ankle
must have made him want to scream out at every
step! Then a realization of the seriousness of
the situation came over Dirk, and he began tearing
at the loose collar at his injured friend&rsquo;s
throat.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he had not spent his time at
Camp Lenape without picking up some bits of
knowledge of first-aid. &ldquo;When anyone faints,
never try to move him&mdash;give him lots of air&mdash;lean
him forward so the blood rushes to his
head&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Muttering these half-remembered
instructions, he bent the limp body forward and
began rubbing Brick&rsquo;s dangling wrists and forearms.
He wished they had brought some water,
but there had been no way to carry it&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>Brick moaned weakly, and his eyelids fluttered.
&ldquo;What&mdash;what happened, huh? Is it
Van? Whillikers, to think that F. X. A. Ryan
passed out like a baby&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; his friend ordered. &ldquo;Just rest
a minute. We&rsquo;re safe for a while now. When
you feel better I&rsquo;ll go get you a drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The injured boy fell back, his chest heaving
irregularly. Dirk stripped off his sweater and
folding it into the form of a pillow, placed it
under Brick&rsquo;s head, slightly downhill. His next
care was to examine the ankle that had been
struck when the boy had escaped, for a second
time, from the half-breed&rsquo;s clearing.</p>
<p>The ankle was swollen badly&mdash;no doubt about
that. Dirk, feeling glad that their captors had
not searched him, found his pocket-knife and
carefully slashed away the strings of Brick&rsquo;s
shoe; he then tenderly removed it, although not
without causing a slight groan from its owner.
The stocking was also pulled off, exposing the
wounded area.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>The ankle looked puffy and discolored, but as
near as Dirk could tell, it was not broken or even
seriously sprained. But none the less, it was
almost a catastrophe for a pair of fugitives in
their plight. Without food of any kind, their
ponchos and blankets left behind them when they
fled from the hut, and with a savage pursuer no
doubt already on their track, they must travel
far and fast. Now, one of them was crippled, in
pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brick,&rdquo; said the boy urgently, &ldquo;do you think
you&rsquo;ll be all right if I carry you a ways? We&rsquo;ve
got to get to water, and I think there&rsquo;s a brook
at the bottom of this hill somewhere. If you&rsquo;re
sure you won&rsquo;t faint again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick clenched his teeth. &ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; he
answered bravely. &ldquo;Gee, I hate to think that
I&rsquo;m holdin&rsquo; up the party this way. Maybe if
you left me, you might find somebody who would
come back and get me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Whatever happens, I won&rsquo;t leave
you, old lad. It won&rsquo;t be much of a job if I take
you with the fireman&rsquo;s lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick grunted as he was hoisted upon his
friend&rsquo;s right shoulder, his body hanging downward
from the waist; but he made no outcry as
Dirk bore him in this fashion down the hill. In
fact, he was so silent that Dirk feared he had
fainted for a second time; but since his head hung
low, he was in no danger. The truth was that he
was gritting his teeth to keep from moaning
when the injured ankle swung slightly in their
progress.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Dirk, for his part, made haste to reach the
brook, for he bore no light burden. But a vision
of what might happen were he to injure his own
legs among the treacherous roots and rocks of
the hillside made him step warily. If both of
them lay hurt in the wilderness, with none knowing
their plight or whereabouts, they would
eventually starve, if they did not sooner die of
exposure.</p>
<p>At long last, the burbling of water over stones
was heard close at hand, and Dirk eased his burden
to the ground. The rains of yesterday had
swollen the little watercourse, and a fairly deep
pool, overhung with brambles and scrub-oak,
glistened beside them.</p>
<p>Dirk wiped the sweat from his face, and took
a deep breath. His first care was to bring his
companion a drink of water in his cupped hands,
and to wash away the sticky grime that clung to
Brick&rsquo;s pale cheeks and forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s swell!&rdquo; sighed Brick. &ldquo;Now, if my
foot was tied up good and tight, maybe I could
hobble on a ways further.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking no chances,&rdquo; answered Dirk
grimly. &ldquo;That hoof of yours looks bad. Here,
move to the bank, right over this place, and
dangle it in the cold water. Best thing to take
down the swelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick Ryan obediently did as he was told. The
shock of the chill water on his ankle set his teeth
chattering, for all the moist heat of the forest;
but soon the injured part became numb, and the
throbbing ache nearly stopped.</p>
<p>Almost an hour passed. During this time
Dirk had not been idle. He had found a straight,
tough sapling of ash with a fork at the top, and
with his knife had shaped the ends to the semblance
of a rude crutch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty warm today,&rdquo; he remarked to the
watching Brick, as he pulled off his khaki shirt
over his head. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t need this.&rdquo; He proceeded
to tear the shirt into strips. The narrowest
of these he laid aside, and bound the rest
over the forked head of the improvised crutch,
making a smooth padding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s have a look at the ankle again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick summoned up a tired grin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much
better, Doc. You couldn&rsquo;t look after me any
better if you had a beautiful nurse to help you.
Say, what do you keep lookin&rsquo; over your shoulder
all the time for?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I doing that? Humph! Guess I&rsquo;m still
scared old Mink will pop his head out at us. I
sure don&rsquo;t want to get kidnaped again with that
ugly lot, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, he had deftly wound
the strips torn from his shirt tightly about the
bruised ankle. The cold-water treatment had
reduced the swelling almost completely, but the
skin showed an ugly black and blue patch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yell out if I hurt too much,&rdquo; he ordered;
&ldquo;but the tighter I tie it, the better it will be.&rdquo;
He rose, and helping Brick to his feet, offered
him the crutch he had made. &ldquo;Now see if you
can get around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick gingerly took a few steps. &ldquo;Gollies,
this is a swell crutch, all right! I&rsquo;m good for a
hundred-mile hike right now. But where do we
head for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Dirk made no answer. Then
something snapped inside him, and he cried out
bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! Where are we? Where is
the Lenape gang? We&rsquo;ve got to find food and
shelter before night, and already it&rsquo;s getting
late! Oh, I don&rsquo;t know where to go, Brick&mdash;but
we&rsquo;ve got to go now, or we&rsquo;re done!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">THE END OF THE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Dirk&rsquo;s momentary outburst passed as soon
as it had come, leaving him heartily ashamed
of his despair. He should not be the one to lose
hope; now, if ever, he must show the manhood
that was in him.</p>
<p>He clapped Brick Ryan on the back, and tried
to summon a smile. &ldquo;There, old man, it&rsquo;s all
right. This whole mess is really my fault&mdash;I
was dumb enough to let myself get kidnaped in
the first place. If you think that crutch of yours
will work, take a good drink and let&rsquo;s hike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick set off eagerly, stumping across the
creek and manfully following Dirk&rsquo;s leadership
through the forest, trying not to drag his tightly-bound
foot or to knock it against the stumps and
boulders that littered the earth. Dirk kept looking
backward to see how his friend was progressing,
stopping now and again to lend an arm in
crossing some marshy bog or climbing a steep
bank. He tried to keep his bearings and follow
a straight line that eventually would bring them
out upon high ground from which he hoped to
spy the lake, the only landmark that either of
them knew.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>He forced Brick to stop frequently, for otherwise
the red-haired lad would have gamely
plodded on until he dropped. During one of the
pauses, Brick asked: &ldquo;Say, since it looks like
we&rsquo;re lost for certain, what about buildin&rsquo; a
smoky signal fire? Maybe if the gang is around,
they&rsquo;ll see it and come to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that. But we don&rsquo;t know that
they are still around. Don&rsquo;t forget they think
we&rsquo;re drowned. And we do know that Mink will
be looking for us. A smoke signal would give
us away&mdash;he&rsquo;d get us before anybody else could
find where we were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On, on they went at the maddeningly slow
pace that made their journey seem like a dream,
one of those nightmares in which the sleeper is
pursued by unknown terror, but must stagger
onward like a man walking under water. The
sun dropped lower and lower above the endless
tree tops.</p>
<p>Brick sank down, and threw his crutch away
from him with a groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on,
Van. My foot&rsquo;s achin&rsquo; like it was stung by a
million bumblebees. If I had somethin&rsquo; to eat,
maybe I could get a little further, but gollies,
this hike is too much for me. You go on,&rdquo; he
pleaded, &ldquo;wherever you can go, and leave me&mdash;leave
me&mdash;&mdash;No half-breed in any old canoe
will ever turn me over and shoot me in the
leg&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His crazy jargon trailed off into a
feverish moan.</p>
<p>It was painfully clear to Dirk that his friend&rsquo;s
strength was completely gone, and that he was
already on the fringes of delirium. The shadows
were lengthening on the mountainside where
they lay; during the last hour they had been
climbing steadily. Soon it would be dark.</p>
<p>The boy looked about him helplessly. Was
this the end? The end of that long trail the
two comrades had followed together, through
capture and fire and flight and injury&mdash;&mdash;He
stood on a rocky shoulder of mountain in trackless
wilds, with his hurt friend huddled at his
feet. If he had a part of the skill of Sagamore
Carrigan, he might, even with only his jack-knife
to help him, rig up some sort of shelter
against the coming cold night, might find some
wild food or trap a small beast. But he could
lean on no other person now; he was alone with
his helpless charge. A keen wind swept up from
the valleys below. It was Dirk Van Horn&rsquo;s
dark hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>As he stared out over the gently waving tree
tops, he could see only endless ridges of hills, one
beyond another, above which the red torch of the
sun blazed like a burning ship. They must have
circled around too far, until now they were on
the other side of the slopes that guarded Lake
Moosehorn. He turned his face upward, where
the summit of the mountain showed against the
sky. As he looked, a pale spark came into being
against the dimming sky. It was a star. No!
Could it be&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>He cried out, and shook Brick&rsquo;s shoulder in a
sudden frenzy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a star!&rdquo; he screamed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a light! A light up there, Brick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never get back,&rdquo; moaned the injured boy
drearily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way from Lenape we
are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake up, Brick! I tell you, I see something
up there. It looks like a tower of some
kind. Brick, we&rsquo;ve got to get there now!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>But Brick Ryan was beyond caring. He did
not even stir as he was lifted in the arms of a
haggard, wild-eyed lad whose heart burned with
new hope. Saving his breath, Dirk made no
further effort to speak. The body of his comrade
hung in his arms, a leaden weight, as he
stumbled forward, his muscles crying out in
weariness, his teeth clenched in a last despairing
endeavor.</p>
<p>A few hundred yards up the slope his feet
touched a worn path, along which was strung on
tree-trunks a line of black wire, leading upward.
It was a telephone line. Somebody was up there,
somebody who could give them food, and fire,
and a place to lie in peace and safety!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, F. X. A. Ryan, my son!&rdquo; Dirk
murmured. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe now, old lad! Up we
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">In the deck-house of the fire tower at Lookout,
young Ugly Brown was staring through the
gathering twilight, scanning the slopes below
through a pair of field glasses lent to him by the
young warden who stood at his side. He was
startled to hear a ringing cry from below, among
the trees bordering the trail. He could not make
out the words, but the tone was desperate. He
was out through the trap-door in an instant, and
was half-climbing, half-sliding down the iron
ladder that hung from the steel cross-pieces of
the tower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, go slow there, youngster!&rdquo; the warden
shouted down after him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break your
monkey neck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ugly did not answer. He had a feeling that
he knew the voice that had uttered the cry that
had come floating up to him through the dusk.</p>
<p>He leaped the last few feet at the bottom, and
raced down the trail. From the dimness of the
woods, a strange pair staggered toward him&mdash;one
ragged, stumbling ghost bearing another, a limp
form in his arms, marching onward with the high
valor that will not admit defeat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Van Horn!&rdquo; Ugly shouted joyfully.
&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter with Brick? We
thought you guys were drowned, but Sagamore
Carrigan wasn&rsquo;t sure, and all the bunch has been
huntin&rsquo; for you all day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off
sharply, and rushed forward to support the
tottering figures.</p>
<p>The young fire warden, who had only delayed
in his tower to snatch a hot thermos bottle and
a pair of blankets, came to his assistance, and
together they knelt over the two exhausted wanderers
where they had slipped to the ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Dirk felt himself lifted up. The steaming
aroma of hot coffee was under his nose, and a
strange voice was ordering him to drink. The
hot fluid burned his tongue, but sent new life
coursing through his veins.</p>
<p>He pushed away the mouth of the bottle, and
sat up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;Look
after Brick. His ankle&rsquo;s hurt pretty bad, and
it got worse because we had to hike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; came an answer. &ldquo;The
fire warden will fix him up pretty quick. Do
you know me, Van? It&rsquo;s Ugly Brown. Gee,
this has sure been an exciting trip! I bet none
of the other gangs that went on the Long Trail
ever had as much fun as we&rsquo;re havin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may have been fun to you, Ugly, but
Brick and I have had a tough time of it. Last
night and today&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to think about
it! Every minute we thought that half-breed
Indian, Mink, was going to jump out on us and
take us back to be held for ransom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire warden, who had been working over
Brick and making him as comfortable as possible
on a blanket, looked up from his task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure that&rsquo;s who it was, when the hut
caught fire this morning,&rdquo; he put in. &ldquo;That is
one bad Indian&mdash;or maybe I should say was.
There&rsquo;s a pretty good chance that he may not be
in the land of the living tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>Dirk sat up suddenly. &ldquo;You mean&mdash;he was&mdash;killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;That was
a pretty bad blaze they had down there at his
shack. It would have been worse, only thank
goodness the woods were damp after the rain;
otherwise our outfit would have had a nice crown
fire to fight today. Collins was patrolling down
by the lake, and had to call a general alarm. By
the time he got there, the whole clearing was
burned over, and all that was left of the trapper&rsquo;s
cabin was a heap of cinders. The men are still
on guard down there&mdash;several acres were burned
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mink&mdash;what happened to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows. If he wasn&rsquo;t burned to
death, you can bet he&rsquo;s cleared out of this country
for good. You&rsquo;ll never be bothered with him
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk laughed feebly. &ldquo;And to think that all
day we were running away from a danger that
didn&rsquo;t exist! We thought he was trailing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The warden looked at him curiously. &ldquo;You
must be pretty done in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>&ldquo;We got lost, and couldn&rsquo;t find our way back
to the lake.&rdquo; The boy looked about him. &ldquo;Where
is this place, anyway, and how is it that you&rsquo;re
here, Ugly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the Lookout, where the fire tower is,&rdquo;
explained the other boy, alive with excitement.
&ldquo;If you get up on top of the hill here, you can
see for a million miles all over these mountains.
The lake is right below. You must have come
around from the other side. Mr. Carrigan
looked at the canoe we found turned over. When
he saw that all the stuff was gone, he said he
thought somebody had captured you. Then he
found where the bushes were tramped down,
over on Flint Island. We couldn&rsquo;t do much last
night in the dark, but he got the chief warden to
give us some grub and a tent. Then, since early
this morning, all of us have been scoutin&rsquo; around
these woods, lookin&rsquo; for signs of you. They
ought to be comin&rsquo; in pretty soon. Boy, won&rsquo;t
they be mad when I tell &rsquo;em I was the one to see
you first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must tell my father,&rdquo; said Dirk. &ldquo;Can
anybody get word?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; answered the warden. &ldquo;Soon
as I get back up the tower, I&rsquo;ll telephone to
Yanceyville, and they can wire from there.
He&rsquo;ll be glad to hear. There was a chance that
you two might have been caught in the fire.
Ever since Riccio was caught, we&rsquo;ve had orders
to hunt for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Riccio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s the name of the man that kidnaped
you! You see, he turned up at the telegraph
office in Yanceyville this morning and
sent a funny message to your father. The telegraph
man was suspicious, and as soon as he left,
he put the sheriff on his trail. It turned out that
this Riccio had a police record, and a bad one,
too. He was arrested, and finally admitted that
he&rsquo;d caught you and that Indian Mink had you
in his shack. He must have been a fool to try
and get ransom money by telegraph. Well,
perhaps a fat jail term will teach him a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Dirk was bewildered. It
seemed as if all their troubles were ended. The
half-breed dead or flown, his master in jail, and
soon the Lenape trailers would again be united.
&ldquo;Then everything&rsquo;s all right, and tomorrow we
can go on to the top of Mount Kinnecut&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He stopped, for Ugly Brown could not conceal
his amusement, and was laughing loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Van, how do you get that way? You&rsquo;re
right on the top of Mount Kinnecut at this very
minute!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>At the words. Brick Ryan stirred among his
blankets and tried to sit up. &ldquo;Mount Kinnecut?&rdquo;
he mumbled. &ldquo;Gollies, that&rsquo;s the place
we got to find. Dirk will help me get there,
won&rsquo;t you, Dirk, my boy? Dirk&rsquo;s the best guy
that ever hit the trail, and I&rsquo;ll lick the bird that
says he&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk Van Horn leaned over and patted his
friend&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;There, take it easy, Brick!
We&rsquo;re there, old chap&mdash;we&rsquo;re right on the top of
old Kinnecut, and you can go to sleep now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go to sleep! Got to do somethin&rsquo;&mdash;can&rsquo;t
climb, though, because I got a bum leg.
You&rsquo;ll do it, though, won&rsquo;t you, Dirk?&rdquo; He
fumbled at his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; the fire warden asked gently.
&ldquo;What must he do? Listen, you come along
with me now, and you&rsquo;ll soon be stowed away in
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. Dirk&rsquo;s got to do it first! And
it&rsquo;s right he should, too. He&rsquo;s the best of all of
us. I wanted to quit, but he fought along, game
as a bull-pup, and carried me. I won&rsquo;t move
till I see him do it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I know what he means,&rdquo; said Dirk
gently. &ldquo;Shall I? I guess he won&rsquo;t rest easy
until it&rsquo;s done.&rdquo; He reached out and took the
crumpled bit of cloth that Brick was clutching.
&ldquo;Ugly, where is the tree that has all the Lenape
trailers&rsquo; flags nailed to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s right up the trail about a hundred
yards. A big old dead pine&mdash;you can&rsquo;t miss it.
I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you stay here with Brick. I won&rsquo;t be
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brick fell back, watching Dirk&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the honor of Lenape, Dirk!&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;You brought us through. There&rsquo;s a couple
nails in my pocket. Good luck to you, pal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dirk clasped the outstretched hand, and ran
up the trail alone. There was the tall pine. A
few wooden cleats were fastened on the lower
part of the trunk, leading up to the thick
branches. As he swung himself upward, all his
weariness fell away from him like a cast-off garment
of care. Up, up he climbed, until he was
among the smooth limbs of the pine. Upward,
above the tree tops that swept down before his
eyes to the sunset-dyed waters of Lake Moosehorn,
that lay in a curving sweep far below, with
the red spark of a campfire on its banks to mark
the rallying place of the Lenape clan. Still he
climbed. Now he was at the very top of the
world; in all directions stretched the unbroken
wilderness that he and his comrades had conquered.
And now his hand touched the lowermost
of a string of tattered pennons that were
nailed to the peak of this mighty tree that others
of the Lenape brotherhood had scaled before
him, in years gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>Dirk Van Horn smiled to himself, and waved
a hand at his watching partner far below. Then,
still smiling, he drew a stone from his pocket,
and with a few resounding blows, nailed a bit of
green and white bunting in its place. A finger
of light, the last ray of the dying sun, tipped the
little banner with gold, as the honor of Lenape
fluttered bravely in the evening breeze.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
